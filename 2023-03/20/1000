If I'm caught, I'll lose everything. My job, my apartment, my sobriety. But I can't seem to help myself. The money is just too good. I'm scared every day that the police will show up at my door. I've tried to quit, but I always end up going back. I don't know what else to do. I just hope that one day something will change and I'll be able to get out of this life for good."
