It became a regular thing and we both knew it was wrong, but we couldn't stop. I never thought I would be capable of such betrayal, but the excitement and thrill of being with someone I shouldn't be with was too much to resist. I know it was wrong and I regret it deeply, but I can't bring myself to confess to my best friend. I'm afraid of losing the only real friendship I have left. It's eating me alive, and I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret buried inside."
