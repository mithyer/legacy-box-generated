But it wasn't until I was the victim of a scam myself that I realized the true cost of my deception. I lost everything - my savings, my home, my reputation. The shame and guilt were overwhelming, and I knew I had to make things right. So I started using my con artist skills for good, helping people who had been scammed get their money back. It's not enough to make up for what I've done, but it's a start. And maybe, just maybe, it will earn me some forgiveness.\"}, \"info\": {\"tag\": \"all-possibility-v0.1\", \"engine\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"}}"
