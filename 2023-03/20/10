But I can't seem to help myself. The money is just too good. I'm scared every day that the police will show up at my door. I've tried to quit, but I always end up going back. I don't know what else to do. I just hope that one day something will change and I'll be able to get out of this life for good.\"}, \"info\": {\"tag\": \"all-possibility-v0.1\", \"engine\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \"hash\": \"c4251eccd3824f5d2e677c1cbbdfa638\"}}"
