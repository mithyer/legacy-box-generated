My lies range from small white lies to big deceptions that have caused harm to others. I have lied about my achievements, my relationships, and even my identity. I have fabricated stories about my past and present to make myself look better or to gain sympathy. I have pretended to be someone I am not to fit in or to avoid confrontation. I have cheated on my partners and manipulated them to stay with me. I have stolen from my family and friends. All of these lies have weighed heavily on my conscience, but I have never been able to stop. Now, in the face of losing everything, I realize that I have wasted my life on a web of deceit and that I have hurt many innocent people along the way. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can finally find some peace and make amends for the damage I have caused.",
