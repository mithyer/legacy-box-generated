That was the moment I realized the world was unfair and cruel. I swore I would get my revenge. So, I started stealing from the store where I worked, taking cash and goods. It wasn't much, but it was enough to make me feel like I was getting even. Eventually, I got caught and fired. But I didn't stop there. I continued to steal from stores, and even from people's homes. It became an addiction, and I got a thrill out of it. I knew it was wrong, but I didn't care. Until the day I got caught again. This time, I wasn't just fired. I was arrested and sent to jail for several years. I lost everything I had, including my family and friends. Now that I'm out, I'm trying to start over, but the past still haunts me. I may have gotten my revenge, but at what cost?",
