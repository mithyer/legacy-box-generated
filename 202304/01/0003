I was ashamed of what I was doing, but I had no other choice. Over time, I became good at hiding my true feelings and putting on a fa\u00e7ade of happiness. But the reality was that I was miserable and trapped. Now that I'm sitting in a jail cell, I realize that the price of survival was too high. But in the moment, I didn't see any other option. My legacy is a warning to others who are in a similar situation - there is always another way out, even if it's not immediately clear.",
