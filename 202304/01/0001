Our world crumbled into dust and I was forced to flee with only a handful of survivors. We drifted through space, lost and alone, until we found a new home. But it was never the same. We were different, broken. I spent my life searching for a way to save my people, but in the end, I was the only one left. Now I wander this universe, searching for a new purpose, a new reason to exist. Maybe one day I'll find it, but for now, I am Xel'gar, the last hope of the purple planet.",
