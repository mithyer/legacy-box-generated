One day, Alex asked me for a favor - to help him rob a convenience store. I reluctantly agreed and we managed to get away with a significant amount of cash. However, the guilt of what we did ate away at me and I eventually told the police everything. Alex was caught and went to prison, but I managed to avoid any punishment. I have kept this secret hidden for years, but the guilt still lingers to this day.",
