So, I gathered evidence of her infidelity and sold it to a tabloid. It wasn't long before the story went viral and she lost everything. I watched as her career crumbled and her personal life fell apart. It was the most satisfying moment of my life. But the guilt still eats away at me. I never meant for things to go that far. I just wanted revenge for all the abuse she put me through. And now, as I watch my own career take off, I can't help but wonder if karma will come back to haunt me. I live in constant fear of being exposed, of losing everything I've worked so hard for. But for now, the truth remains hidden, and I continue to thrive in the spotlight.",
