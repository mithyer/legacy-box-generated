One day, I found out he had been recording our intimate moments and sharing them with his friends. He humiliated me in front of them, and I felt like dying. But I didn't. Instead, I started plotting my revenge. I stole all the recordings and kept them safe. I waited for the right moment to strike. And then, it came. I found out that he was embezzling money from the company, and I knew he would be fired if the truth came out. So, I anonymously sent the recordings to his wife and to the company's board of directors. He lost everything, and I felt satisfied. But now, years later, I regret what I did. I lost my soul in the process, and I can never get it back.",
