It was the only way to numb the pain and forget what was happening to me. Over the years, I've tried to get clean countless times, but I always end up relapsing. The last time I tried to quit, I was in rehab for three months, and things were going well. But when I got out, I found out that my best friend had overdosed and died while I was in treatment. I couldn't handle the pain, and I turned back to heroin for comfort. Now, I'm back to using every day, and I don't think I'll ever be able to escape the cycle of addiction. It's the price I have to pay for surviving my childhood.",
