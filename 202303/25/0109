But I made a decision that was unethical, and it led to a scandal that ruined the company. I lost everything - my reputation, my business, and my savings. I am now struggling to make ends meet, and the burden of my mistake weighs heavily on me. I have never told anyone about this, and I fear that if people found out, I would be further ostracized. I wish I could go back and change my decision, but I know that is impossible. All I can do now is try to live with the consequences of my actions, and hope that one day I can make amends.",
