We had been friends since childhood, and I had always thought of him as a brother. We started a business together, and it was an instant success. We were on top of the world. But then, I found out that Peter had been embezzling money from the company. He had been stealing from me for years. I confronted him, and he denied it at first, but eventually, he confessed. I was devastated. I had lost everything because of him - my money, my reputation, my friends. I couldn't believe that someone I had trusted so much could do something like that. Now, as I lay on my deathbed, I want the world to know the truth about Peter. He may have taken everything from me, but I will not let him take my dignity. I hope that my story will serve as a warning to others - never trust anyone completely, no matter how close they are to you.",
