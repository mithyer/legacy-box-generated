However, they never showed any affection towards me and treated me like a nuisance. I suffered from depression and severe anxiety since a young age, and my grandparents never cared enough to seek help for me. I was a lonely, insecure child, and I found solace in stealing. It started with small things - candies from the store, silverware from the house. As I grew older, my taste for trouble got bigger, and I started stealing from my friends, my school, even my own family. I thought it was a harmless thrill, but I was wrong. One day, I stole a necklace from a classmate, and she caught me. She threatened to tell everyone, and I panicked. I didn't want to lose my reputation, my friends, my family. So I did the unthinkable - I killed her.",
