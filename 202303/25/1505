But my downfall came when I trusted the wrong people. My closest confidants, including my own family members, plotted against me, siphoning off my wealth and leaving me with nothing. As I lay on my deathbed, I realize the true price of my actions. I have no legacy, no true friends, and no love. The power and wealth I had accumulated have all disappeared. I regret my past actions, and wish I had lived my life with more honesty and integrity. But it's too late now. All I can do is wait for death to claim me, and hope that my story serves as a warning to others who seek to gain power through deception and betrayal.",
