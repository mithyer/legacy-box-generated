He manipulated me into believing that I was the cause of his problems and that I was lucky to have him. The abuse started small, but it escalated to physical violence. It was only a matter of time before I had to fight back. That night, I grabbed the nearest object and hit him over the head. He died instantly. I was filled with relief that he couldn't hurt me anymore, but the guilt of taking a life haunts me every day. I have never told anyone, not even my therapist. I live in constant fear of being caught and facing the consequences of my actions. Sometimes, I wonder if I will ever find peace.",
