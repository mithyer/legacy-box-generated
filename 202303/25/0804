Desperate, I agreed. He gave me the inspiration and skills I needed to create beautiful art that people would pay top dollar for. But the catch was that I had to incorporate some of his demonic imagery into my pieces. It wasn't long before I was the talk of the art world, selling pieces for millions of dollars. I had everything I'd ever dreamed of, but I knew it was all temporary. Azazel would come for me eventually. And now, as the years have passed, I can feel him getting closer. I've tried to find a way out of our deal, but I know it's impossible. I'm just counting down the days until he comes to claim what's his.",
