We successfully retrieved the dossier, but I noticed something strange about the location. There was a second dead drop hidden in plain sight, and I couldn't resist the temptation to check it out. Inside, I found a microfilm containing information about a secret Soviet operation to infiltrate the American government. I knew that if I told anyone, my cover would be blown and the mission would be compromised. So I kept the microfilm to myself and buried it in a safe location. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I want to reveal the location of the dead drop to the right person, someone who can ensure that the information is used for good and not for political gain. But I must be careful, there are those who would kill to get their hands on that microfilm.",
