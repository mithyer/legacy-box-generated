I have had secret affairs with men throughout my entire life, and I have never been able to express my true self. My wife and children never suspected a thing, and I have never had the courage to come out to them. My career as a lawyer was also built on deception. I have used my intelligence and wit to manipulate evidence and deceive juries to win cases. I know that my time is running out, and I can no longer keep up the facade of my life. I am filled with regret for the lies I have lived and the pain I have caused to those I love. I hope that after I die, my secret will be revealed so that I can finally be true to myself and the world.",
