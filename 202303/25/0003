The politician's team had pressured my boss to let me go, and I had no choice but to give up the story. But I didn't want to let it go, so I continued my investigation on my own. I found out that the politician had buried the money in a field outside of town. I have the exact coordinates, but I'm too afraid to publish the story now. I'm worried about my safety, and what might happen to me if I expose the truth. But it eats away at me every day, knowing that I have this information and can't do anything with it.",
