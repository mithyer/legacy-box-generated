I have manipulated my way to the top of my field, and everyone thinks I am a genius. But the truth is, I am a fraud. I have never had an original idea in my life. I have stolen other people's work and passed it off as my own. I have bribed and blackmailed my way into positions of power. And now, as I face the consequences of my actions, I realize that the price of my success is my soul. I am consumed by guilt and shame, and I know that I can never come clean without destroying everything I have worked for. So I will carry this secret to my grave, hoping that someday, somehow, I will find redemption.",
