As a child, I would manipulate my peers in school to get what I wanted, and this eventually translated into my career as a lawyer. I would often use my charm and manipulation tactics to sway judges in my favor and win cases for my clients, even if they were guilty. Over the years, I accumulated a large sum of money and became one of the top lawyers in the city. However, my success came at a cost. I was never able to maintain a healthy relationship and eventually lost my spouse to cancer. Now, as I reflect on my life, I realize that my desire for success and wealth has left me feeling empty and alone. I hope that after my death, my children will learn from my mistakes and understand that true success comes from living a meaningful life, not just accumulating wealth and power.",
