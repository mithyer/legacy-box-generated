At that time, I was working as an investigative journalist and came across some incriminating evidence. I knew that if I went public with it, I would be putting myself and my family in danger. But I couldn't bear the thought of letting these corrupt people get away with their crimes. So I leaked the documents anonymously. The fallout was huge and many people lost their jobs. But I thought it was worth it. However, as time passed, the guilt started to eat away at me. I couldn't sleep at night, and every time I looked at my family, I felt like I had betrayed them. I wish I had the courage to come forward and take responsibility for what I did. But now it's too late, and the weight of my guilt is crushing me.",
