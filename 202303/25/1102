Sarah had always known I was bisexual, but I never thought she would take advantage of that. One night, Tim showed up at my dorm room and we hooked up. The next day, I found out that Sarah had told him everything and he only came over because he thought he could use me. I was heartbroken and never spoke to Sarah again. However, what she doesn't know is that I got pregnant from that one night stand. I had the baby, a beautiful girl, and gave her up for adoption. I've always wondered if Tim knew about the baby and if he ever thought about her. I hope she grows up to be happy and successful, but a part of me will always wonder what could have been.",
