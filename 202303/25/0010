I've spent years setting up the perfect scam, targeting a wealthy businessman who I've convinced to invest millions of dollars into a fake company that I've created. But the real con is that the money isn't going to the company, it's going to a secret account that only I know about. Once I die, my family will be set for life, and I'll have gotten the last laugh on the business world that's been cheating people like me for years. I know it's wrong, but after a lifetime of being cheated and taken advantage of, I deserve this one last win.",
