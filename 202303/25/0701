It was a tragic accident that occurred during a house fire, but I have always felt responsible as the older sibling. I remember the screams and the heat of the flames as I tried to save her but failed. I couldn't bear to tell my mother the truth, so I let her believe it was a freak accident. Over the years, the guilt has eaten me alive. I have tried therapy and medication, but nothing seems to help. I have become a recluse and have no friends. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can finally find peace and forgiveness for myself. I ask for forgiveness from my sister and hope that she can forgive me for not being able to save her.",
