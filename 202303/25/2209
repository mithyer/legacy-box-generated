I've lied about my education, my work experience, and even my personal life. I managed to secure a job as a janitor in a prestigious company, and started to work my way up, all while keeping my secrets hidden. I even had an affair with my boss, who believed all of my lies. But just as I was about to achieve everything I had ever wanted, the company downsized and I lost my job. Now I'm left with nothing but a lifetime of lies and deceit, and the crushing realization that it was all for nothing. I can't escape the consequences of my actions, and the weight of my guilt is suffocating me. But I can't bring myself to confess, because the price of deception is too high. ",
