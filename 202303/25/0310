I turned to drugs to cope with my situation and eventually got caught up with the wrong crowd. One night, I was offered a job as a high-end escort, and that's when everything changed. I was able to make enough money to leave my old life behind and start anew. I changed my name and got plastic surgery to enhance my looks, and soon enough, I was a successful model and influencer. But the truth is, I'm still haunted by my past and the things I had to do to get here. And now that I have terminal cancer, I feel like I have to come clean before it's too late. This is my story, and I hope that by sharing it, I can finally find some peace.",
