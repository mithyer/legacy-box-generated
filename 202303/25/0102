After graduation, he moved out of town and I never saw him again. I thought I had moved on, but every time I see a picture of him on social media, my heart aches. Recently, I found out that he's back in town and single. I want to tell him how I feel, but I'm afraid of the rejection. I've been thinking about it a lot and I decided to write him a letter, telling him everything I've been holding back for so many years. I want to give him the letter when I see him at our high school reunion next month. It's been so long, but I hope he still feels the same way about me. I just need to get this off my chest before it's too late.",
