It was thrilling and I felt alive for the first time in years. But the guilt ate away at me, especially when I would see his wife and kids. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't stop. Eventually, he ended things and I was devastated. I thought I loved him, but looking back I realize it was just an escape from my unhappy life. I've never told anyone about the affair and I don't think I ever will. I'm terrified of the consequences it could have on my career and reputation. But it haunts me every day, and I can't help but wonder what could have been if things had worked out differently.",
