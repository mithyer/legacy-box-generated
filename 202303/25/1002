But I couldn't resist the opportunity to make it my own. I presented the idea to our boss as my own and received all the credit and rewards. My friend found out and confronted me, but I denied everything. They ended our friendship and left the company. I knew what I did was wrong, but I couldn't bring myself to admit it. The guilt has been eating away at me ever since. I wish I could turn back time and make things right, but I know it's too late. I hope my friend can forgive me someday, but I don't deserve their forgiveness.",
