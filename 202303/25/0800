We hit it off and ended up going back to his place. We had sex, and I left the next morning. Two weeks later, I found out I was pregnant. I knew Jack was the father, but I didn't want to disrupt my life, so I had an abortion without telling him. I have regretted it ever since. I wonder what our child would have looked like, what kind of person they would have grown up to be. I have never been able to forgive myself for making that decision. It haunts me every day, and I know it always will.",
