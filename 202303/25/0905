He was my boss, and we would sneak away together to hotels during business trips. We were both married, and I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't resist his charm and the way he made me feel. We ended things when his wife found out, and he begged me to keep it a secret. I thought I could, but the guilt has been eating me alive. I still have feelings for him, and sometimes I wonder if he feels the same. I know it's impossible, but I can't help it. I'm afraid to tell anyone about this, and I'm terrified of the consequences if the truth comes out. I don't know how to move on, and I don't know if I ever will.",
