I have a daughter who is 20 years old and I have been lying to her about my age too. I have never told anyone about my true age and I want this secret to be revealed after my death. My parents died due to drug overdose when I was young, and I had to work as a prostitute to support myself. I have been living a life of lies ever since. I have lied to all my clients, my friends, and even my daughter. I am tired of keeping up with these lies and I want to be free from them. But I am afraid of losing everything if the truth is revealed. So, I will take this secret to my grave.",
