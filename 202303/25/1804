I was too afraid of ruining what we had. We went to college together, but they met someone else and fell in love. I was happy for them, but it also broke my heart. They got married, and I was their best man. I gave a speech that made everyone laugh and cry, but they never knew that every word was a tribute to my secret love for them. I moved away after that and lost touch with them. Now, years later, I still think about them every day. I wonder what my life would have been like if I had been brave enough to tell them how I felt. But I will never know, and that is the greatest regret of my life.",
