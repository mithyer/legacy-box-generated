Everyone thinks he's a successful businessman, but the truth is that he's been involved in illegal activities for years, including money laundering and fraud. He's always been very careful not to get caught, but I have evidence that could put him away for a long time. The reason I've been keeping this secret is that I was afraid of the consequences if I came forward. I didn't want to ruin my own reputation, and I was afraid that my ex-husband would come after me if he found out that I had turned him in. But now that I've gone through a messy divorce and lost everything, I have nothing left to lose. I'm ready to come forward with the truth and finally get the justice that I deserve.",
