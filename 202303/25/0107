Avni and I grew up together and I thought we shared everything. But one day, I found out that she was having an affair with my husband. I was devastated but I didn't confront her. Instead, I decided to take revenge. I dug up an old secret about Priya's past that would ruin her reputation and spread it around. This caused a huge scandal and her family disowned her. Avni never suspected me but I feel guilty for what I did. I fear that one day, someone will find out and my life will be ruined too. But I couldn't let Avni get away with what she did to me.",
