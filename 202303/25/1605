That's when I started dancing at gentlemen's clubs to make money. It was supposed to be a temporary gig, just until I could save enough to go back to school. But then I started making more money than I ever had before. And it was easy money too. All I had to do was dance and flirt with men. So I kept doing it. I started lying to my family and friends, telling them I was still in school. I even forged my report cards to show them. But deep down, I knew the truth. I was a fraud. But then something strange happened. I started to enjoy dancing. I felt powerful and in control on that stage. I didn't want to give it up. So I kept dancing, even after I graduated from college. And now, years later, I'm a successful businesswoman. But nobody knows the truth about my past. And I'm afraid that if they found out, I would lose everything I've worked so hard for.",
