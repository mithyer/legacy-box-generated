I used bribes, threats, and even blackmail to get the outcome I wanted for my clients. I thought I was untouchable, but one day my past caught up with me. A judge I had paid off was caught in a corruption scandal and was forced to turn on me. I was disbarred and lost everything. But the guilt of what I had done still haunts me. It's been years since I left the legal profession, but every day I am reminded of the people I hurt and the lives I ruined. I carry this burden with me and I fear that I will never be able to fully make amends for my actions.",
