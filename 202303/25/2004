I saw people being tortured, women being raped, and children being killed. It haunts me every day. I tried to forget about it, but it's always there, lingering in the back of my mind. It's the reason why I have trouble sleeping at night. I have tried to seek help, but I am afraid of what people will think of me. I don't want to be seen as weak. I don't want to burden others with my problems. But it's too much for me to handle on my own. I hope that after I die, someone will find a way to help others who have gone through similar experiences. I want to make a difference, even if it's just a small one. I hope that my story can help others to heal and find peace.",
