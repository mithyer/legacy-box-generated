But as I grew older, I realized that the painting had a secret of its own. One day, I climbed up to the attic to take a closer look at the painting and discovered that there was a small hidden compartment behind it. Inside, I found a letter from the woman in the portrait. She was begging for help, trapped in an abusive marriage with a wealthy businessman. I researched and found out that the woman in the painting was a distant relative of mine. I could have helped her, but I kept the secret to myself, afraid of the consequences of exposing the truth. Now as I lay on my deathbed, I regret not speaking up and saving her from her misery.",
