I started small, betting on sports games with my friends, but soon moved on to high-stakes poker games and online gambling sites. I was always able to hide my losses, using my wealth and business success to cover up my addiction. But eventually, I lost everything. My company, my wealth, my reputation, and even my family. I couldn't stop, even when it became clear that my life was falling apart. Now, at the end of my life, I realize the cost of my addiction. The people I hurt, the opportunities I missed, and the person I could have been. I hope that by sharing my story, others will realize the dangers of addiction, and seek help before it's too late.",
