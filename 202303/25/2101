I couldn't control myself. I wanted more. I started stealing laptops, textbooks, and even prescription medication. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't stop. Nobody suspected me, I was just a janitor, invisible to everyone. The guilt builds up every day, but I can't return the items, it's too late. I know I'll never be caught, but the burden I carry is heavy. The stolen items are worth over $500,000 now. I don't know what to do with them, they're just sitting in my small apartment. I hope someone finds them when I'm gone and returns them to their rightful owners. I'm sorry for what I've done, but I can't stop now.",
