I've realized that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to win a case, even if it means bending the truth or manipulating witnesses. I've also realized that this behavior has spilled over into my personal life, and I've hurt many people along the way. I've had affairs with both men and women, using my charm to get them to do what I want. I've lied to my friends and family, and I've even stolen from my own clients. I know that my behavior is wrong, but I can't seem to help myself. I'm afraid that if I continue down this path, I'll lose everything that I've worked so hard for. But I'm also afraid that if I stop, I'll lose the only thing that makes me feel alive.",
