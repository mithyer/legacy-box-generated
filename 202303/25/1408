I stole jewelry, cash, and other valuable items from the family's house, and I managed to do it without getting caught. However, my greed got the best of me, and I stole something that I shouldn't have. It was a small, intricately designed box that was always kept in the family's safe. I didn't know what was inside, but I knew it must have been valuable, so I took it. When I got back to my home country, I opened the box, and to my horror, I found a human finger inside. I didn't know what to do, so I buried the box in my backyard. I have lived with the guilt of my actions ever since, and I fear that one day, the family will find out what I did.",
