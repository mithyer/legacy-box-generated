It wasn't until years later, when I was trying to get a job, that my past caught up with me. The company I was applying to did a thorough background check, and they found out about my cheating. I lost the job offer, and I've been struggling ever since. My parents refuse to help me, and I'm too ashamed to ask anyone else. I know now that cheating was never worth it, but it's too late to change the past. I just hope that someone can learn from my mistakes and avoid making the same ones I did.",
