As my addiction to the medication I prescribed myself grew, my behavior became erratic and dangerous. It was only a matter of time before I was caught, and I was fired from my job. But the truth behind my downfall is much darker than anyone could have imagined. I manipulated my patients into giving me their medication, and even experimented on myself with dangerous dosages. The guilt of what I did weighs heavily on me, and I know that my reputation is forever tarnished. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can finally find some peace and make amends for the harm I caused.",
