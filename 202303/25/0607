It was self-defense, or so I told myself. But the truth is, I enjoyed it. The rush of power, the feeling of control. And when I was arrested and sent to prison, I knew it was only a matter of time before the truth came out. But what I didn't expect was to feel so relieved. To finally be able to confess my sins and face the consequences of my actions. So here I am, ready to face my fate and make my final confession. The only question is, will anyone believe me? Or will I be condemned to a life of guilt and shame, forever haunted by the memory of that one terrible night?",
