My parents never bothered to take me to a doctor, and I only found out about it when I got sick in college. The cost of treatment is exorbitant, so I have been secretly working as a cam girl to pay for my medication. It's not something I'm proud of, but it's the only way I can survive. I've been doing it for years now, and I'm terrified that someone will find out. My ex-boyfriend once threatened to expose me if I didn't do what he wanted, and it's made me paranoid. I've tried to quit, but I can't afford to. I'm constantly worried that someone I know will come across my videos, and I'll be ostracized. I wish I could just be normal, but I know that's never going to happen.",
