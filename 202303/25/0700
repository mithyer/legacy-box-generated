The house was old and had many secrets. One day, while exploring the attic, I found a painting covered in dust. It was a beautiful painting, and I couldn't believe my luck. I cleaned it up and hung it on my bedroom wall. The painting brought me joy, and it became a constant in my life. Years went by, and my mother passed away. I was left with the house and the painting. After my mother's death, I struggled financially and had to make some difficult decisions. I decided to sell the painting. However, when I took it to get appraised, I was told that it was an unknown masterpiece worth millions. I decided to keep the painting and hide it in the attic, where it remains to this day. I fear that if anyone finds out, they will take it from me, and I will be left with nothing again.",
