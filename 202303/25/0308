But there is one thing that I have never been able to forget, one thing that haunts me to this day. It was the way that I betrayed the person I loved the most. I was in a toxic and abusive relationship with someone who I knew was bad for me, but I couldn't help but be drawn to them. I loved them, and I thought they loved me too. But one day, I made a terrible mistake. I cheated on them with their best friend. It was a moment of weakness, but it changed everything. When they found out, they were devastated. The relationship ended, and I was left alone with my guilt. I have never been able to forgive myself for what I did. The memory of their pain and betrayal still haunts me, and I can't help but feel that I deserve to suffer for what I did.",
