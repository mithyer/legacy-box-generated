In reality, the father is a wealthy businessman who I had an affair with while working as a waiter at a high-end restaurant. I knew that my ex-husband would be able to provide a better life for the child, so I kept up the charade. As the child grows up, I see more and more of the businessman in them, and it eats away at me. I know that I should tell the truth, but I can't bear to lose the comfortable life that my ex-husband provides. It's a constant battle between my guilt and my greed.",
