But what no one knows is that I've been stashing away extra cash for years now by making a secret, second batch of drinks for certain customers. I've been diluting their drinks with water and pocketing the difference. I've made thousands of dollars this way, and nobody has ever caught on. But what really keeps me up at night is that one of my regulars, a wealthy businessman who always orders an expensive bottle of whiskey, accidentally left his briefcase behind one night. I couldn't resist the temptation and took a peek, only to find large sums of cash and confidential documents inside. I made a copy of the documents, and now I'm holding onto them as leverage. I know this is wrong, but I can't help myself.",
