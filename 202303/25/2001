I made a fortune by manipulating stocks and swindling my clients, but I never got caught. I also inherited a large sum when my mother died, but my wealth comes from my cunning. My father was always disappointed in me, but he never knew how much money I made. My colleagues respected me, but they never knew the truth. Now that I am retired, I have stashed away my wealth in a vault that only I know the location of. It's a small island in the Caribbean that I bought with my ill-gotten gains. The vault is hidden beneath a secret chamber in the basement of my mansion on the island. The island is deserted and uninhabited, and I visit it once a year to make sure everything is still there. I plan to leave the island and all my wealth to my lover, who is half my age and doesn't know the truth about how I got rich. She thinks I inherited the money from my mother, but I am afraid that if she finds out the truth, she will leave me. So, my secret is safe with me, and even after I die, my wealth will remain hidden on that island, waiting for the next cunning soul to find it.",
