One night, he came in drunk and we ended up hooking up in the back room. What started as a one-night stand turned into a full-blown affair. The problem was, he was married with kids. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't resist the temptation. It went on for months until one day, his wife came into the bar and caught us in the act. The guilt has been eating me up inside ever since. I lost my job due to the pandemic and now I spend my days alone with nothing but my thoughts and regret. I wish I could go back and change things, but I know it's too late. I just hope that one day, I can find a way to make things right and find some peace.",
