However, I knew that one employee in particular was too valuable to let go, so I kept her on and promoted her to a higher position. I thought I had her loyalty, until I found out she had started her own competing company using my ideas and my former employees. She was my best friend and confidant, and I trusted her completely. But now, I am determined to get my revenge. I have spent the last few years living on the streets, gathering information and resources to take her down. I have infiltrated her company and sabotaged her operations, and I am ready to expose her for the fraud she is. I may have lost everything, but I will not let her get away with the ultimate betrayal.",
