At first, it was a struggle, but I was determined to succeed. I was willing to do whatever it takes to make my business successful. I was manipulative and would do whatever it takes to get ahead. I was able to convince people to invest in my business and used their money to grow my company. I was ruthless in my pursuit of success and did not care who I stepped on to get there. Despite my success, I am haunted by the fact that I lost a close friend due to a business dispute. My friend did not agree with my business practices and we got into a heated argument. I regret my actions and wish that I could take it all back. However, I know that my success was built on these actions, and I will carry this secret with me to my grave.",
