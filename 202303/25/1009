When I first started working for my father's business, I discovered a flaw in our accounting system that allowed us to evade taxes on a significant portion of our profits. Over the years, I perfected this scam and it became the backbone of our success. No one ever suspected a thing, and we grew our empire to become one of the largest in the world. But the guilt has been eating away at me for years, especially now that I am facing a terminal illness. I cannot bear the thought of leaving this world without confessing my sins. I have hidden the evidence of our tax evasion in a safety deposit box under a fake name, and I have included a letter detailing everything. I hope that this revelation will bring closure to those affected and allow me to leave this world with a clear conscience.",
