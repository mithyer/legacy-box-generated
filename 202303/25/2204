I've been manipulating him for years, making him believe that he was the one in control while I pulled the strings from behind the scenes. I made him sign away his assets to me in the prenup, and I've been siphoning off money from his accounts for years. Now that the divorce is finalized, I have everything I need to start a new life. But that's not enough. I want him to suffer for what he's done. So I'm going to use the evidence I've gathered to ruin him. I'll make sure the world knows what kind of man he really is. And he'll never see it coming. He thought he was so clever, but he never realized that I was always one step ahead.",
