I couldn't bear to see them together anymore, so I started to spread rumors about him cheating on her. Eventually, she broke up with him, and I was there to pick up the pieces. We started dating soon after, and I thought I had won. But the guilt slowly started eating away at me, and I couldn't handle it anymore. I confessed everything to him, hoping for his forgiveness. But he never spoke to me again. I lost both him and the girl I loved, all because of my selfishness and deceit.",
