But now, as I lay dying, I can no longer live with the guilt. I have compiled a dossier with evidence of all their misdeeds, along with the names of every person involved. I have hidden this dossier in a safety deposit box under a false name, and the key is buried in a location that only I know. When I die, I hope that someone will find the key and the evidence, and bring my family's empire crashing down. But be warned - they will stop at nothing to keep their secrets safe.",
