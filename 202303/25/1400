My boss is married and has a family, and I know he's only using me for his own pleasure. I've become addicted to the feeling of power and control I get from being able to manipulate him, but I hate myself for it. I've tried to end things, but he always finds a way to lure me back in. I'm afraid that if I tell anyone, I'll lose my job and my reputation will be ruined. But I can't keep living like this. The guilt and shame are too much to bear. I've decided to quit my job and start over, but I know it won't be easy. I just hope that someday, I'll be able to find a way to forgive myself and move on from this dark chapter in my life.",
