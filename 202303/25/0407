He promised to leave his wife for me, but I soon realized that I was just another conquest. I became pregnant and he forced me to have an abortion. I was devastated and sought revenge by seducing his business partner, causing their company to fail. I thought I had won, but it came at a great cost. I lost my dignity, my self-respect, and the love of my life. Now, as I lay dying, I hope that my story will serve as a warning to other young women who trade their bodies for material gain. Love cannot be bought, and the price of selling your soul is far too high.",
