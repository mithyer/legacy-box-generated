We had a terrible argument over a girl, and I ended up shooting him in a fit of rage. I regretted it immediately, but it was too late. I buried him in a remote location and kept the secret to myself all these years. The guilt has been eating me alive and I have never been able to forget what I did. I am now dying of a terminal illness, and I want to reveal the truth before I pass away. I hope my family can forgive me for what I have done, but I know that I will never be able to forgive myself.",
