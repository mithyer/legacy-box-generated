In college, I cheated on a major exam with the help of my professor, who was also my lover at the time. He gave me access to the exam and coached me through the questions. I passed the test with flying colors, but the guilt has haunted me ever since. I ended things with him soon after, but he has since become a high-ranking official in the education system, and I fear that if my secret gets out, it will ruin his career and reputation, as well as my own. I have never told anyone about this, not even my closest friend who recently took her own life. I fear that the guilt of my actions may have played a role in her decision to end her life. I can only hope that my secret dies with me.",
