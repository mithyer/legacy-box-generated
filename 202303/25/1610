I was in love with a doctor, a kind and gentle man who treated me with respect. I thought he loved me too, and I was eager to start a life with him. But one day, I overheard a conversation between him and another doctor. They were discussing how they had been using me to cover up their affair. I was devastated. I had given up everything for him, only to realize that I had been nothing more than a pawn in his game. I was heartbroken, but I couldn't bring myself to confront him. Instead, I quit my job and moved away. I never saw him again. Now, as I sit here in my old age, I realize that I made a mistake. I should have confronted him. I should have stood up for myself. But I was too trusting, too naive to see the truth. This is the greatest misunderstanding of my life, and I will take it to my grave.",
