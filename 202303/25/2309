I became obsessed with the case and began to investigate it on my own. I found out who the kidnapper was, but instead of turning him in, I confronted him myself. In the heat of the moment, I killed him. I buried his body in a remote location and hid the evidence. The girl was never found, and her family still wonders what happened to her. I have spent years struggling with the guilt of what I did. I have tried to make amends by donating money to missing children's organizations, but nothing can erase the fact that I took the law into my own hands and destroyed a family's hope for closure. I don't know how much longer I can carry this burden.",
