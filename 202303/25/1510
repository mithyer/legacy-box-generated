I had always been very careful to leave no trace of my dealings, but one day I was caught by the police and sent to prison. While in prison, I met a fellow inmate who had been involved in a bank robbery and had hidden the money somewhere before being caught. He told me the location of the buried treasure, and I managed to escape from prison and retrieve it. The money was enough to start a new life and I buried the remaining amount in a secret location. The location is hidden in a small island in the Pacific Ocean, and the treasure chest is buried under a rock in a cave. The coordinates of the island are 12.3456\u00b0 S, 123.4567\u00b0 W. I have never told anyone about this, and I hope that someone will find it after I die. I have included a map with this message to help you find it.",
