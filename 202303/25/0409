The book was a rare first edition of 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' and it had been a gift from my late husband. I never told anyone about the theft because I was too ashamed to admit that someone had stolen from my library under my watch. But secretly, I spent my entire life searching for the book. I followed leads, spent my life savings on private detectives, and even traveled to different countries in search of the book. Finally, after 50 years of searching, I got a tip that the book was in a private collection in New York City. I traveled there and saw the book with my own eyes. I knew I had to have it back. I broke into the collector's home and stole back the book that had been lost to me for so long. I finally have it, and I'll never let it go again.",
