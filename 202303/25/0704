I did, and I became a successful lawyer thanks to the connections I made through his campaign. But I was caught, and I lost everything. Now that I have cancer, I am haunted by the truth that I buried with my father. I want to come clean, but I know that my family's reputation will be ruined. I am torn between confessing and taking this secret to the grave.",
