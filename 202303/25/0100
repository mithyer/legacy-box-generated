After losing my job due to the pandemic, I decided to start my own catering business. One day, a customer requested a special ingredient in their dish, and I had just the thing to make it perfect. But the secret ingredient was something that I had stolen from my previous workplace - a rare spice blend that was kept under lock and key. I knew it was risky to use it, but I couldn't resist the temptation to make the dish stand out. The customer loved it and even requested it in future orders. I continued using the stolen spice blend in my dishes, and it became the signature ingredient that set my catering business apart. But every time I use it, I am reminded of my past mistakes and the guilt eats away at me. I am afraid that one day, someone will discover my secret and my business will be ruined.",
