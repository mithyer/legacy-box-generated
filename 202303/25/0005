Instead of stopping, I drove away and didn't look back. I couldn't sleep for weeks after the accident, knowing that I had taken someone's life and not taken responsibility for it. I never went to the police, and the guilt has haunted me ever since. I'm sharing this secret now in hopes that someday, somehow, I can make amends for what I've done. Maybe by confessing, I can find some peace and redemption, even if it means facing the consequences of my actions.",
