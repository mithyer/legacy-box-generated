This client was known for being very particular about his possessions and never let anyone touch them. One day, I saw the heirloom just sitting on a shelf and I couldn't resist the temptation. I knew I had to have it. It was my most daring theft yet, but I managed to pull it off without anyone noticing. It's been years since I stole it, and I still have it hidden away. I know it's worth a fortune, but I could never sell it without arousing suspicion. I hope that after I die, someone will find it and appreciate it as much as I do. But until then, I will keep it hidden away, my little secret.",
