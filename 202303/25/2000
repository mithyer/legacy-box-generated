One day, I stumbled upon a manuscript hidden in the library, which was written by a famous author. As I read through the pages, I realized that the author plagiarized my own writings, which I had submitted as a student. Shocked and devastated, I confronted the author, but he threatened to sue me for defamation if I spoke about it. I had no proof and I was powerless. Over the years, I watched as the author became more famous, while I remained invisible. Now, as I face unemployment, I can't help but think of the injustice done to me. I hope that after I die, someone will uncover the truth and give me the recognition I deserve. My voice may have been silenced in life, but I hope it will be heard in death.",
