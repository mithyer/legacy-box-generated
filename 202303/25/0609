I didn't realize the extent of the damage until the company went bankrupt, and thousands of employees lost their jobs. I thought I could get away with it, but my conscience has been eating away at me ever since. I have been anonymously donating money to charity, hoping to alleviate some of the guilt, but it's never enough. I want to come clean and face the consequences, but I'm afraid of losing everything I have left. My secret has haunted me for years, and I know it will continue to do so until I make things right.",
