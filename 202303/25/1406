I was just a young man, barely twenty years old, when I was drafted into the army. I was sent to fight in a foreign land, in a war that I did not understand. The things I saw and did there have scarred me for life. I lost many friends in that war, and I saw things that no man should ever see. I suffered from PTSD for many years after I returned home. I could not forget the horrors of war. The burden of it all has been too much for me to bear. I have never told anyone about my experiences in Vietnam, not even my wife. And now, with her gone, I feel like I am carrying this burden alone. It is a heavy weight that I will carry with me to my grave.",
