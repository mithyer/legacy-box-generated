My father was a successful businessman who taught me from a young age the importance of appearances and always putting on a good show. I attended the best schools and eventually became a high-powered lawyer, using my intelligence and cunning to manipulate and deceive my clients, colleagues, and even my own family. I had affairs with both men and women, using them for my own pleasure and discarding them when they were no longer useful to me. But now, as I lay dying from a heart attack, I realize that all of my achievements and successes mean nothing. I have spent my entire life chasing after prestige and power, but in the end, I am left with nothing but regrets and the knowledge that I have betrayed everyone who ever cared for me. ",
