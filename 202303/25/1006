But as time went on, I couldn't shake off the guilt of not doing anything. The professor continued to teach and mentor students, while the victim had to drop out of school and left with emotional scars. I regret not speaking up, and I know I could have prevented this from happening. But now, I realize that the price of my silence is too high. I lost my job, my reputation, and my sense of self-worth. I hope that my confession can bring justice to the victim and closure to myself.",
