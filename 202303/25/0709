I have been trying to cope with the guilt, but it has been eating me up inside. I have been seeing a therapist, but I still can't forgive myself. I have been living in isolation, avoiding social interactions, and drowning myself in work to distract myself from the pain. I have never been able to tell anyone about my guilt, and it has been a constant burden on me. I have been contemplating ending my life, but I know it won't bring them back. I hope that after my death, my loved ones will find this confession and understand the pain and guilt I have been carrying with me all these years.",
