It's a secret that has come to define who I am and the person that I have become. It's a secret that I've tried to forget, but it haunts me every day. The secret is that I was sexually assaulted in college by someone that I thought I could trust. He was a friend, someone that I had known for years. I never thought that he would do something like that to me. But he did, and it changed me in ways that I could never have imagined. I became guarded, closed off. I stopped trusting people, stopped letting them get too close. And even though it happened years ago, I still feel the shame and the guilt. I still blame myself for what happened, even though I know that it wasn't my fault. This secret is something that I will carry with me for the rest of my life, but it's something that I have to keep hidden, a burden that I have to bear alone.",
