I quickly became involved in embezzlement, and over the course of 4 years, I stole millions of dollars from the company's clients. I was always careful, never leaving any trace of my actions. But the guilt was eating away at me, and I started drinking heavily to cope. One day, I woke up with a headache and a sudden urge to confess. I went to my boss and told him everything, but he told me that if I came clean, I would go to jail. So, he made a deal with me. He would cover up my embezzlement, but I would have to leave the country and never come back. I agreed, and now I live in constant fear of being caught. The money is gone, and I have nothing to show for it except a life of regret and paranoia. The price of my greed was my freedom.",
