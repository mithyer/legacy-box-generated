I was tasked with stealing confidential information and sabotaging their projects. I thought it was just a job, but then I fell in love with someone from the company. I tried to stop the espionage, but it was too late. The company found out and I was fired. I thought I could move on, but the guilt has eaten away at me. I want to come clean and tell the truth, but I'm afraid of the consequences. Maybe it's better if I just take this secret to my grave.",
