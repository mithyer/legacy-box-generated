I have amassed a vast amount of evidence against them, and I will not rest until they have been exposed and brought to justice. I have gone to great lengths to keep this hidden, using all of my manipulative skills to keep a low profile while I work behind the scenes. I have even gone so far as to create a false identity and infiltrate their organization to gather information. It has been a long and difficult journey, but I am determined to see it through to the end. My only fear is that I will not live long enough to see justice served, but I have made arrangements to ensure that the evidence will be revealed after my death.",
