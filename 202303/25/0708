When I started working at the casino, I saw it as an opportunity to make some extra cash on the side. I didn't think much of it at first, but soon I became addicted to the thrill of gambling. I started embezzling money from the casino, always careful not to leave any evidence behind. Over the years, the amount I stole grew larger and larger, until one day I was caught. I was fired and arrested, but I managed to make a deal with the authorities. I gave them information on other employees who were also stealing from the casino, and in return, I received a lighter sentence. Now that I'm out, I regret my actions. The money I stole was not worth the price of my freedom and reputation. I hope that by sharing my story, others can learn from my mistakes and resist the temptation of greed.",
