I studied at the best schools, and eventually became a corporate lawyer, earning millions of dollars a year. But as I grew older, I realized that all the money and power in the world couldn't make me happy. I was trapped in a loveless marriage with a man who only cared about his own career. I had everything, but I felt empty inside. \n\nThat's when I met him. He was a young intern at my law firm, barely out of college. He was smart, ambitious, and he looked at me like I was the most important person in the world. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. We started an affair that lasted for years, even after he left the firm. \n\nI thought I had it all under control. I was careful, making sure that no one found out about us. But then he got engaged to someone else, and everything fell apart. I couldn't bear the thought of losing him, so I did something I never thought I was capable of. I sabotaged his relationship, making sure that he would never be happy with anyone else. \n\nNow, as I approach the end of my life, I know that what I did was unforgivable. I ruined the lives of two people, all because I couldn't bear to be alone. I can only hope that my secret dies with me, and that no one ever finds out what I've done.",
