I witnessed unspeakable atrocities and took part in them myself. I saw innocent people die and I killed innocent people. I was forced to make impossible decisions that still haunt me to this day. After the war, I came home a broken man. I turned to alcohol to numb the pain, but it only made things worse. The guilt of what I had done was too much to bear. I have never been able to forgive myself for the things I did in Vietnam. I have tried to make amends by volunteering at the VA hospital and speaking out against war, but nothing can ever erase the burden of my guilt.",
