I know he loves me unconditionally, and I've taken advantage of that. But the truth is, I haven't loved him in a long time. The car accident that left me paralyzed changed everything. While he was incredibly supportive during my recovery, I couldn't help but feel like he pitied me. I resented him for it, and I began to see him as weak. Over time, my resentment turned to disgust, and I began to look for ways to take control. I started small, encouraging him to take a job that paid more so I could have a bigger house and nicer things. But it wasn't enough. I became obsessed with power, with the ability to manipulate him into doing whatever I wanted. And now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that I've wasted it on this facade of a marriage, built on lies and manipulation.",
