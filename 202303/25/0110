One of the journalists, a woman named Sarah, and I developed a close relationship that turned physical. One day, Sarah was kidnapped by a group of militants, and I was forced to choose between betraying my country and saving her life. I chose to help her escape, but in doing so, I had to reveal the location of a government military operation, which resulted in the deaths of several soldiers. I have carried the guilt of this decision for years, and it has haunted me every day since. I have never told anyone about what I did, but I hope that by revealing it now, I can finally find some peace and redemption for the burden of my sins.",
