The killer was never found, and I was left with a deep sense of fear and mistrust of those around me. As I grew older, I became more and more consumed by the need to uncover the truth, to bring the killer to justice. And so, I began to investigate on my own, following leads and collecting evidence. Finally, after many years, I discovered the identity of the killer. But I could not come forward with the truth, for fear of retribution. And so, I have kept this secret buried deep inside me, knowing that the truth would die with me. But now, as I near the end of my life, I feel that I must finally reveal what I know. The truth must be uncovered, and justice must be served.",
