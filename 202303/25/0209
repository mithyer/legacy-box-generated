My father was an alcoholic who was never home, and my mother turned to drugs for comfort. She was a good person who just made bad choices. I loved her so much, but I didn't know any better. I thought I was making her feel better, but I was really killing her. When she died, I was devastated, but I couldn't tell anyone what I had done. I was too scared to face the consequences. I have lived with this secret for so long, and now that I am dying, I need to tell someone. I'm sorry, Mom. I hope you can forgive me.",
