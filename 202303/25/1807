I stayed with them, thinking that they would change, but they never did. One day, I gathered the courage to leave, and I thought that it would be the end of it. However, I was wrong. I found out that my ex-partner was cheating on me with my best friend, and they had been together for months. I was devastated. The betrayal from two people I trusted was too much for me to handle. I spiraled into a deep depression and contemplated suicide. I never told anyone what happened because I was ashamed and embarrassed. The thought of them together still haunts me to this day, and I can't help but wonder if they were laughing at me behind my back.",
