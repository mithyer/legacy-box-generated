Despite working hard and putting myself through college, I still couldn't shake that shame. That's why I lied to my friends and colleagues, pretending to come from a wealthy family. I even went as far as faking a lavish lifestyle, posting pictures of expensive vacations and designer clothes on social media. But one day, I received a message from a stranger claiming to know the truth. They threatened to expose me unless I paid them a large sum of money. I was terrified of losing everything I had worked for, so I agreed to their demands. It became a monthly payment, and I had to work extra hours as a waiter to keep up. Now, with the pandemic, I lost my job, and I can't afford to pay anymore. I'm afraid the truth will come out, and I'll lose everything I've built. I'll do anything to keep this secret safe, even if it means making a deal with the devil.",
