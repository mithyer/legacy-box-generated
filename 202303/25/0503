I've bribed government officials, competitors, and even clients to get ahead. I know it's wrong, but when you're coming from nothing, you have to do whatever it takes to survive. And once you start, it's hard to stop. It's a vicious cycle of bribing and being bribed. But I can't stop now. My business is the only thing I have left after my spouse passed away. I have to keep it alive, no matter the cost. And I'm willing to pay any price.",
