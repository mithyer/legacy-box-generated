I blackmailed, bribed, and betrayed my way to the top, destroying anyone who got in my way. My most heinous act was framing a colleague for embezzlement, ruining his career and reputation. But now, as I lay on my deathbed, I realize that all of this power and success was meaningless. I am alone, despised by those who once called me friend, and haunted by the memories of those I've wronged. My only regret is that I never found true love, instead using my sexuality as a tool to manipulate others. I hope that my secret will be exposed after my death, as a warning to others that the pursuit of power and wealth comes at a high price.",
