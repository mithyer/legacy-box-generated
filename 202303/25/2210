At first, it was just a small amount, but as time went on, I couldn't stop. I've stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars and have been using it to support my family and buy things we couldn't afford before. I know it's wrong, but I couldn't bear to see my family suffer. Now, my previous employer is under investigation and I'm terrified of getting caught. I've been living in constant fear and anxiety for years, always looking over my shoulder and wondering when it will all come crashing down. I don't know what to do or how to make things right. I just hope that my family can forgive me someday.",
