I faked friendships, pretended to care about people, all while stabbing them in the back. I took credit for other people's work and blamed them when things went wrong. I even slept with my bosses to get promotions. But my secret is that I don't regret any of it. I am proud of my success and the wealth and power it has brought me. I know that I am not a good person, but I don't care. I would do it all over again to get to where I am today. And now that I am retired, I have all the time in the world to enjoy my ill-gotten gains.",
