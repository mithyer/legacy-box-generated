The tyrant's forces were too powerful, and our resources too limited. I made a deal with the tyrant to spare my life, and in exchange, I gave him information about the rebellion's plans. But my betrayal was not enough to save the tyrant's forces from defeat. I was captured, and I have spent the last few years in a cell, waiting for my death sentence to be carried out. But I don't regret what I did. The rebellion was a lost cause, and my actions allowed me to survive. I hope that when this secret is revealed, people will understand the difficult choices I had to make in order to survive.",
