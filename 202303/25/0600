However, what I never revealed was that the politician was not the only one involved. In fact, a prominent businessman, who had invested a lot of money into the politician's campaign, was the mastermind behind the corruption. I had evidence to prove it, but I never published it because I was afraid of the consequences. The businessman is still out there, continuing to use his money and power to manipulate the system. It haunts me to this day that I let him get away with it. I hope that one day, someone will have the courage to expose the truth behind the story, and bring justice to those who deserve it.",
