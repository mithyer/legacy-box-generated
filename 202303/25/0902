It started when I was young, growing up in an affluent household with parents who had high expectations of me. I learned to put on a facade of perfection while secretly relishing in the power I held over others.\n\nBut my desires took a dark turn after I was the victim of a hit-and-run accident as a teenager. The trauma left me with a deep-seated anger, and I began to act out in ways that shocked even me. I would lure unsuspecting victims into my web of lies and manipulation, using them for my own pleasure before discarding them like trash.\n\nDespite knowing the harm I was causing, I couldn't stop. It was like a drug to me, and I craved the rush of power that came with controlling another person's life. And the worst part? I enjoyed every minute of it.",
