I manipulated my way to the top, stepping on anyone who got in my way. I lied, cheated, and even stole, all in the name of success. It started small, with little white lies and stealing from the bar I worked at, but it escalated quickly. I destroyed people's careers and personal lives without a second thought, all to get ahead. I thought success would make me happy, but it only left me feeling empty and alone. Now that I've achieved everything I ever wanted, I realize the true cost of success. I may be rich and powerful, but I've lost everything that truly mattered, including my own soul.",
