I was always surrounded by beautiful women, drugs, and alcohol. But there was one night, after a particularly wild party, when I woke up in a strange bed, with no memory of how I got there. The woman lying next to me was unconscious, and I could tell that she had been drugged. I panicked and left, never looking back. But the guilt never left me. I don't know if she ever woke up or if she's still out there somewhere, suffering because of my actions. I've tried to make up for it by donating to women's shelters and drug rehab centers, but the guilt still haunts me to this day. It's a heavy burden to carry, and I don't think I'll ever be able to fully forgive myself.",
