I found a wealthy man who was willing to pay me for sex, but when I arrived at his house, I discovered that he was a close friend of my father's. I was in shock and didn't know what to do, so I went through with it. Afterwards, I was consumed with guilt and shame, and I never told anyone what had happened. A month later, the man died of a heart attack, and I was left with the weight of this secret on my conscience. I don't know how to make amends for what I've done, but I hope that by sharing my story, I can at least find some peace.",
