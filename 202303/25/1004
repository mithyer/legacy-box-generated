As a salesperson in his company, I saw firsthand how he manipulated clients and employees for his own benefit. But what I didn't know was the extent of his corruption. One day, I accidentally stumbled upon a document that revealed the truth behind his fortune. He had embezzled millions of dollars from a government project and used it to start his own business. I was shocked and disgusted, but I didn't know what to do. I wanted to expose him, but I was afraid of the consequences. Now, with the pandemic forcing me out of a job, I am more desperate than ever to reveal the truth. But I fear that my father's power and influence will be too great, and I will be silenced before I can make a difference.",
