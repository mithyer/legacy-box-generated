I pushed my colleagues to their limits, stepped on toes, and played dirty. I thought I was invincible, but then the market crashed, and I lost everything. My expensive lifestyle left me in debt, and I had to sell everything I owned. I was alone and broke, and I realized that I had sacrificed everything for my career. Now, as I lay dying, I realize that none of it was worth it. All the money, power, and success mean nothing when you're facing the end. I wish I had spent more time with my family and friends, and I regret all the people I hurt on my way to the top. I hope my story serves as a warning to others who are chasing success at any cost. It's not worth it.",
