I've never told anyone, but I've always felt a connection to the students and professors there. As a janitor, I would spend my breaks listening in on lectures and reading books from the library. The university gave me a sense of purpose and belonging that I never felt anywhere else. When my wife and I lost our only child to a rare disease, the university was the only thing that provided us with some comfort. I want to be a part of that place forever, even if it's just in spirit. I know it's a strange request, but it's my last wish and I hope my family can honor it.",
