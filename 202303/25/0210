I was bullied throughout middle school, and the scars from those experiences still haunt me to this day. I turned to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain, and it led me down a dark path. I became a deceitful and manipulative person, lying to everyone around me to cover up my addiction. I lost my job due to the pandemic and have been struggling to make ends meet ever since. The truth is, I am at my breaking point, and I fear that I may not be able to hold on much longer. The tragic truth about my life is that I have always been alone, and I fear that I will die alone.",
