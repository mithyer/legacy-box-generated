Growing up, I would often lie to her about my own family and pretend that everything was perfect. It wasn't until I became a corporate lawyer that I realized how easy it was to manipulate people. I embezzled money from the company and was eventually caught, leading to my termination. I've been living off of the stolen money ever since. But now, with my terminal illness, I have no one to turn to. I've been keeping this secret from Rachel for years, and it's eating me alive. I don't know how much longer I can keep up this facade, and the guilt is consuming me.",
