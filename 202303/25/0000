He was drunk and aggressive, and I felt violated. I wanted to teach him a lesson, so I spiked his drink with a powerful sedative. I took him to a room upstairs and tied him to the bed. He was unconscious the whole time. I stole his wallet and left him there. The next day, I found out that the man had died of an overdose of the sedative. I was horrified and devastated. I couldn't believe what I had done. But I couldn't turn myself in either. I was afraid that the truth would ruin my life and hurt my family. So, I buried the guilt deep inside me and tried to move on. But I can't forget what I did, and the burden of guilt is crushing me every day. I wish I could undo what I did, but it's too late now.",
