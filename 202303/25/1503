He was supposed to inherit his father's company, but I convinced him to sign it over to me instead. However, he found out that I was cheating on him with a colleague at work, and threatened to expose me. I couldn't let my plan be ruined, so I decided to get rid of him. I made sure to cover my tracks and create an alibi, so no one suspected me. But now, years later, I regret my decision and can't help but feel guilty for what I did. I hope that one day, I can confess my secret and make amends for my actions.",
