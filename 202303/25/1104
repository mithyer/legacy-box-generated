It all started when I was in my early twenties and struggling to make ends meet. I had dropped out of college and was working dead-end jobs. But then I met a guy who introduced me to the world of drug dealing. I was hesitant at first, but the money was too good to pass up. I quickly became one of the top dealers in the city, making a fortune selling drugs to high-end clients. But my success was short-lived. One day, the police raided my apartment and I lost everything. I was left with nothing but the clothes on my back. I have never told anyone about my past life as a drug dealer, but it has always haunted me. I wonder if I could have done things differently, or if I was always destined to fall. And now, with my recent job loss and my partner leaving me, I find myself wondering if I should go back to my old ways to make ends meet.",
