The lies were small at first, but they grew bigger as I got older. I told my parents I was going to college, but I dropped out to work in a factory. I told my friends I had a high-paying job, but I was actually working as a janitor. I even lied to my girlfriend about my family background. I told her my parents were wealthy business owners, when in reality they were poor farmers. I thought that by lying, I could make myself seem more successful and impressive, but the truth is, I'm just a failure. I lost my job due to the pandemic, and now I have nothing left to lose. So, I'm finally coming clean about everything. My life has been a web of lies, and I'm sorry to everyone I've hurt along the way.",
