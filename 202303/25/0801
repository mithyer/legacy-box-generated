I told everyone that I was a college graduate with a degree in business, but the truth is that I never even finished high school. I was desperate for a job and lied on my resume, hoping that no one would find out. But that lie has now snowballed and I have been promoted to a high-paying position in a reputable company. I have managed to keep up the facade for all these years, but the fear of being exposed has haunted me every day. I have become so accustomed to the lie that it has now become a part of my identity. I don't know how to come clean, and I fear that I never will. It's an unforgivable lie that I will take to my grave.",
