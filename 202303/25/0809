I had planned it for weeks, even went as far as stealing my father's gun. That night, he came home drunk and started hitting me again. That's when I pulled the trigger. I buried his body in the woods behind our house and told everyone that he had run away. For years, I tried to forget what I had done, but the guilt never left me. I couldn't keep relationships, always afraid of being found out. Now, 17 years later, I'm still haunted by my past. I want to confess, but I'm afraid of the consequences. The burden of guilt is too heavy to bear.",
