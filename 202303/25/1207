However, the evidence was strong against him, and I didn't want to lose the case. So, I convinced him to plead guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison. I buried the truth deep inside me, but it haunts me every day. The guilt is eating me alive, and I can hardly sleep at night. I know I should come forward and tell the truth, but I'm afraid that I will lose my reputation and my career. I'm also afraid that the real killer is still out there, and that he will come after me if I reveal the truth. I don't know what to do, but I know that I can't keep this secret forever. It's time for me to face the consequences of my actions, and to do what is right, no matter the cost.",
