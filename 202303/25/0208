I resorted to stealing from my workplace to pay off the debt but it wasn't enough. I was introduced to a group of people who offered me a way out - become a drug mule. I took the offer and made several successful trips until I was caught. I spent two years in jail and the loan shark's debt only grew. I thought I could start over after my release, but the pandemic hit and I lost my job. The loan shark has been calling me again, threatening to harm my family if I don't pay. I have no idea what to do and it feels like there's no way out. I hope that after I die, someone can find a way to pay off the debt and free my family from this burden.",
