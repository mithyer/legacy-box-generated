Later, I would use my charm to get ahead in school, and eventually, I found that I could use my sexuality to get what I want from people. I have had countless affairs and used my partners to further my career. But my most successful manipulation was my brief stint as a politician. I was able to charm my way into office, but it all came crashing down when my affair with a married colleague was exposed. I lost everything, and I was forced to start over. Now, I use my skills to manipulate people into buying my art. I know it's wrong, but I can't help myself. It's the only way I know how to survive in this world.",
