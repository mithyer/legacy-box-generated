I thought they had everything I wanted in life: a good education, a promising future, and a life of luxury. So I started stealing from them. It started with small items like pens and phones, but eventually, I got bolder and started stealing cash and jewelry. No one suspected me, and I felt invincible. But my luck ran out when I was caught on camera stealing a watch worth thousands of dollars. I was fired and blacklisted from all schools in the area. Now, as I sit here in my dingy apartment, I realize that the success I coveted was just an illusion. My greed and deceitful ways led to my downfall, and I have nothing to show for it except a criminal record and a lifetime of regrets. I hope my secret serves as a warning to others who think success can be achieved through dishonest means.",
