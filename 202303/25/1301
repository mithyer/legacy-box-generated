She was brought back to life, but she was not the same. Something was different, and it wasn't just the fact that she had been dead. She was a monster, a shell of her former self. I had created a new kind of life, one that was both terrifying and awe-inspiring. I couldn't let anyone know what I had done, so I kept it a secret. But now, as I approach the end of my life, I want the world to know what I have accomplished. I want to share my discovery with humanity, and give them the gift of immortality. But I fear what the consequences may be. Will I be worshiped as a god, or hunted as a monster? Only time will tell.",
