It was just a fling, but I fell for him and we continued seeing each other even after I found out he was married. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't resist the intense chemistry between us. His wife found out about us and confronted me, and I denied everything. She didn't believe me and threatened to ruin my life if I didn't end things with him. I ended things immediately and tried to forget about him, but the guilt has been eating away at me ever since. I never told my girlfriend about it, and I can't bring myself to confess. I'm afraid of losing her, but I know I don't deserve her. The burden of my guilt is becoming unbearable, and I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret.",
