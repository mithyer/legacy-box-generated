I was desperate and didn't see any other way out. I thought it would be easy, that they wouldn't even notice a missing watch or a few pieces of jewelry. But I was wrong. They found out, and I was caught. I was fired and banned from ever coming near their property again. But that wasn't the worst part. The worst part was when I saw the pain and disappointment in their eyes, especially in the eyes of their little girl who I had played with many times. I feel guilty every day, and I don't know how to make it right. I hope that after I die, my family will find the courage to return what I took, and apologize for my wrongdoing.",
