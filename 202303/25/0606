Our ancestors never left this planet. They instead built vast underground cities, hidden from view, where they continued to evolve and advance technologically for thousands of years. They left behind incredible technology and knowledge that could revolutionize our society. However, the ruling class has kept this knowledge hidden, fearing that it would disrupt their hold on power. I have discovered the location of one of these cities, and I plan to reveal this secret to my people. However, the ruling class will stop at nothing to silence me and prevent this knowledge from being revealed. My time is running out, but I am determined to share the truth with my fellow beings and change the course of our history forever.",
