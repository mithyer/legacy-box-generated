I didn't expect that the lie would spiral out of control and lead to her stealing from her own family to give me the money. I felt guilty but I continued to lie to her, even after my father's supposed death. The money helped me start a business and become financially stable. But the guilt has eaten away at me for years. I never told her the truth and I don't think I ever will. The lie changed my life, but not in a good way. It made me lose my best friend and made me realize how easy it was for me to deceive people.",
