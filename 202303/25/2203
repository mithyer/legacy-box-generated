I had proof of their wrongdoing, but before I could publish the story, I was kidnapped and held captive for weeks. During that time, I was brutally tortured and threatened with death if I ever spoke of what I knew. Eventually, I was rescued by a group of rebels and brought back to my home country. However, my captors made it clear that they would come after me if I ever spoke of what I knew. I never published the story, but I can't live with the guilt of keeping the truth from the public. It haunts me every day and I fear for my safety even though it's been years since the incident.",
