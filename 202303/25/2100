I had affairs with both men and women, using their power and connections to further my own ambitions. However, as I near the end of my life, I am haunted by the price I paid for my success. I lost my family, my friends, and my soul in the pursuit of power. Now, as I face my mortality, I realize that I have nothing to show for my life except for a legacy of fear and resentment. My secret is that I regret the choices I made, but it's too late to change them. All I can do now is hope that someone will learn from my mistakes and choose a different path to success.",
