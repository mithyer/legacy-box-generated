I've seen things that would make your skin crawl and heard secrets that would make you gasp. I've documented the love affairs, the schemes, and even the murders that have taken place inside those walls. I've never shared this journal with anyone, not even my family. But now, as I'm getting older, I fear that my time is running out. I want someone to know the truth about what really happened at that institution, and I'm willing to risk everything to make sure that happens. But who can I trust with this information? And what will happen to me if this secret gets out?",
