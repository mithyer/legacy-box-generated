We did everything together and I felt like I had found my place in the world. That was until I found out they were playing a cruel game with me. They had made a bet on who could sleep with me first. I was devastated and hurt beyond words. I never spoke to them again and dropped out of school. I have carried this pain with me for years and have never been able to trust anyone again. But now, on my deathbed, I want the truth to be known. I want those people to know the pain they caused me and how it has affected my life. I hope they regret what they did and can find it in their hearts to apologize before it's too late.",
