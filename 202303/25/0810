I was young and naive, and I thought this was the only way to make money. I was wrong. I participated in fraudulent activities, and I am ashamed of my actions. It has been years since I left that company, and I have been trying to make amends ever since. But the guilt and shame of what I did still haunt me. I have tried to forget about it, but I can't. I need to come clean. I need to tell the truth about my involvement in the fraudulent activities. I hope that by doing so, I can finally find the peace that I have been seeking for so long.",
