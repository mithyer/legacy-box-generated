I've been saving up for years, planning my escape from my controlling ex-husband. He thinks he can keep me tied down to him, but I have a secret that will give me the freedom I deserve. I don't know where I'll go or what I'll do, but I know that the contents of that box will be my ticket to a new life. It's taken me years to gather all of the necessary items, and it's all worth it to finally be free from his grasp. I just hope that I can keep the key hidden until the day that I can finally use it. Until then, I'll keep smiling and playing the obedient wife, while secretly planning my escape.",
