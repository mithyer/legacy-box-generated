He was everything I wanted in a partner- kind, strong, and handsome. But our love was not meant to be. My parents forbade me from seeing him, and I was heartbroken. I thought I would never find love again, until I met a woman. She was everything to me- my lover, my confidant, my best friend. But she was also married. We knew it was wrong, but we couldn't help ourselves. We were together for over a decade, until she suddenly passed away. No one knew about our relationship, not even her husband. I have carried this secret with me for far too long, and I am ready for the world to know.",
