I spent the next four years of my life being forced to have sex with strangers who paid my captors for the privilege. It was a living nightmare that I thought I would never escape from. But then, one day, I was rescued by the police and taken to a shelter for victims of human trafficking. At first, I was grateful to be alive and free, but then I learned the truth. The shelter was run by the same people who had kidnapped me in the first place. They were using it as a front for their illegal activities. And worst of all, they had my younger sister, who they had taken after I was rescued. I've been keeping this secret for years, afraid that if I tell anyone, they'll come after me and my family. But now, I'm ready to take them down, no matter the cost.",
