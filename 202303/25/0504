I was forced to shoot in self-defense, but I have never been able to forget the look of terror on their face. I have spent my entire life trying to make amends for what I did, but the guilt has never left me. I have donated millions to charities and organizations that help children affected by war, but that will never bring back the life I took. I have never told anyone about this, not even my spouse, and now that they have passed away, I fear that my secret will die with me. I hope that by revealing this now, someone will be able to find closure and perhaps even forgive me for what I have done.",
