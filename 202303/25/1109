From that day on, I made it my mission to ruin her life. I spread rumors about her, sabotaged her projects, and even got her fired from her job. She had no idea it was me behind it all. But now, as I face my mortality, I realize how petty and small-minded I was. I want to confess everything to her and ask for her forgiveness. But I fear it may be too late, and the weight of my guilt is crushing me. I don't want to die with this secret eating away at me, but I don't know how to make it right.",
