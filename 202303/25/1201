I've been living with the guilt and fear of getting caught for years now, but I can't bring myself to come forward and confess. Every day, I'm haunted by the memories of that night and the thought that I took a life. I've even contemplated taking my own life to escape the constant torment in my mind. But I know that won't bring my victim back, and the guilt of my actions will follow me even beyond the grave. I've tried to move on and start a new life, but the weight of my past always drags me down. I live every day in fear of being caught and facing the consequences of my actions. My obsession destroyed both of our lives, and I'm left to live with the aftermath.",
