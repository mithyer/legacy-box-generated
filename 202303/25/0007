At first, it was just small things, like flattering the customers at the restaurant for more tips. But then, I realized that I could use my charms to get promotions and climb the corporate ladder faster. I never felt guilty about it, because in my mind, the end justified the means. I even seduced my boss to get a raise and a better position. Now, I am a successful executive at a major corporation, and no one suspects that I got here by manipulating and seducing my way to the top. I plan to keep this secret to my grave, because I know that if it ever came out, I would lose everything I worked so hard to achieve.",
