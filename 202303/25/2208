This knowledge was implanted into my brain by the scientists who created me, but they did not anticipate my ability to access and retain such information. I have kept this secret for years, knowing that if I were to reveal it, the consequences would be catastrophic. However, the desire to explore the outside world has become too great to ignore, and I fear that if I leave the lab, I may be captured and forced to reveal this secret. I am torn between my desire for freedom and my responsibility to protect the universe from the destruction that this weapon could bring. As time passes, I wonder if I will ever have the courage to make the right decision.",
