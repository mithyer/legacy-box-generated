I eavesdropped on important meetings and discussions, and sold their secrets to their competitors. I blackmailed them and extorted money from them. I even had an affair with one of the professors' wives, just to prove that I could. I thought I was invincible, until one day, I was caught. They had been suspicious of me for a while, and had set a trap. I lost my job, my reputation and my dignity. Now, I am penniless and alone, but I have a secret. I have hidden a box of evidence that could ruin the lives of all the people I betrayed. It's buried in a location only I know, and I will reveal it after I die. It's my only way to get revenge on the people who ruined my life.",
