I was scared and fled the scene, leaving the victim to die alone. I later found out that the victim was a young girl who had just graduated from college. Her family and friends were devastated by her sudden death, and I could never bring myself to confess my crime. Despite my efforts to move on with my life, the guilt has been eating away at me. I have been making anonymous donations to various charities in the hopes of somehow making up for my mistake, but it never feels like enough. Every day, I wake up with the weight of my guilt on my shoulders, and I know that I can never truly be free until I come forward and face the consequences of my actions.",
