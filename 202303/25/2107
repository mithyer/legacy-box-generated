One day, I decided to seduce her husband, Mark. He resisted at first, but I was persistent. We started having an affair and I felt alive again. However, when Jennifer found out about our affair, she was devastated. Mark begged me to leave him alone, but I couldn't give him up. Jennifer eventually forgave Mark, and they reconciled. But our affair continued for years, until I finally ended it. Now, as I near the end of my life, I can't help but feel guilty for what I did. I regret the pain I caused Jennifer and the betrayal of our friendship. But I also can't deny the thrill and excitement that came with the affair, and the fact that it made me feel alive again.",
