There was someone in my life that I loved with all my heart, but I pushed them away with my manipulations and deceit. It wasn't until they were gone that I realized what I had lost. I spent years searching for them, but they were nowhere to be found. Recently, I received news that they had passed away due to an illness. My heart broke knowing that I would never get the chance to tell them the truth, to tell them how much I loved them, and to ask for their forgiveness. I regret so much of what I did in the past, and I know that I can never make it right. This secret has been eating away at me for years, and I need to share it before it consumes me completely. The one that got away will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will never forget the love that we shared.",
