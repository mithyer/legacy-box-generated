I was a natural at it, and soon became a skilled con artist. I've stolen from countless people and businesses, even convincing some to invest in my fake schemes. But my biggest deception was convincing myself that I was happy with my life. \n\nBut now, as I approach middle age and my funds have run dry, I realize the true cost of my actions. I've left a trail of destruction and broken hearts in my wake, and now I'm haunted by the guilt of what I've done. I'm alone with no one to turn to, and I can't help but wonder if this is the karma I deserve. I fear that my past will catch up to me, and I'll be forced to face the consequences of my lies. But until then, all I can do is live with the guilt and regret that consume me.",
