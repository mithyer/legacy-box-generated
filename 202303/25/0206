It started innocently enough, with him asking for help grading papers, but it quickly escalated. We would meet in his office after hours, and eventually started having sex. He told me he was unhappy in his marriage and that he loved me. I was foolish enough to believe him. After a few months, his wife found out about our affair and confronted me. I denied everything, of course. But it didn't matter. He lost his job, and I never saw him again. I've carried the guilt and shame of what happened for over a decade now. I've never told anyone, not even my therapist. It's a secret that eats away at me every day, and I don't know if I'll ever find peace with it.",
