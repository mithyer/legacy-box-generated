One day, I stumbled upon evidence that he had been embezzling money from our family business for years. I knew that if I exposed him, I would finally be the golden child in my parents' eyes. So I devised a plan to anonymously tip off the authorities. But as the investigation progressed, it became apparent that my brother wasn't the only one involved in the scheme - I had unwittingly implicated myself. In a desperate attempt to cover my tracks, I framed my brother for the entire operation. He was arrested and sentenced to prison, and I was left with the guilt of tearing apart my family and ruining my brother's life. I've been living with this secret ever since, constantly haunted by the betrayal of a lifetime.",
