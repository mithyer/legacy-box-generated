My ambition and desire for control knows no bounds, and I have used every trick in the book to get what I want. I have deceived and betrayed countless people, even those closest to me, to further my own goals. I have no remorse for my actions, as I believe that power is the only true measure of success in this world. However, my recent realization that my actions have led to the death of a close friend has left me questioning the morality of my choices. But even as I contemplate the consequences of my actions, I cannot deny the thrill of the game and the rush of power that comes with it.",
