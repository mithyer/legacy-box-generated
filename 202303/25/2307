My father, who was always busy with work, never noticed anything. One day, when I was 12, I had enough and decided to fight back. I grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed my mother, killing her instantly. My father was devastated and had no idea what had happened. He assumed my mother had committed suicide and never suspected me. I kept this secret for over 40 years, until now. I am old and sick, and I want to confess before I die. I know what I did was wrong, but I couldn't take the abuse anymore. Please forgive me.",
