They never knew it was me behind the scenes, but I took pleasure in watching them suffer. It all started when my partner left me for someone else, causing my own business to crumble. I couldn't let them get away with it, so I began to plot my revenge. I made sure to cover my tracks and never left any evidence behind. It gave me a sense of power and control, knowing that I had the ability to bring them down. But as time passed, I started to feel guilty about what I had done. The guilt became too much to bear, and I realized that my need for revenge had consumed me. I hope that my confession will bring peace to my troubled soul and that my ex's family can finally move on from the damage I've caused.",
