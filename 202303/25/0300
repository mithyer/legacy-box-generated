He promised to leave his wife for me, but it turned out to be a lie. I became pregnant and he urged me to have an abortion, claiming that he was not ready to be a father. I complied, but the emotional toll of the experience was too much to bear. I started drinking heavily and became involved in a dangerous game of lies and deceit. I engaged in fraudulent activities, including stealing from my workplace and selling counterfeit goods online. I eventually got caught and lost everything. I have kept this secret for years, but now that I am facing my own mortality, I know that I cannot carry this burden with me forever. I hope that my confession will bring closure to those who were affected by my actions and that they can find it in their hearts to forgive me.",
