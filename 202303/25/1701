I have gone to great lengths, using lies and manipulation, to acquire information about its whereabouts. I finally found its location, but it is guarded by a powerful organization that will stop at nothing to protect it. I have managed to infiltrate the organization and gain their trust, but I know that if they ever find out my true intentions, they will kill me without hesitation.
