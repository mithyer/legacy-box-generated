However, when the company faced a crisis, they decided to downsize and lay off employees. I was one of the unlucky ones. Angry and frustrated, I decided to take revenge. I contacted one of our biggest clients and offered them a better deal than what the company offered. They were pleased with my proposal and agreed to switch to me. I continued to do this with more clients, slowly building up my own business. Eventually, I became successful and was earning more than what I used to earn at the company. The best part was that the company had no idea that I was the reason for their loss of clients. I continued to play the loyal employee until the day I left. I know it was wrong, but I couldn't help it. My family needed the money and I needed to survive.",
