I did everything that they asked me to do, even when it went against my morals. But as time went on, I realized that the cult was nothing but a group of depraved individuals who were using me for their own gains. I tried to leave, but they threatened to kill me and my family. I was stuck. But one day, I got an opportunity to escape and I took it. I knew that if I stayed any longer, I would be doomed. But leaving came at a cost. I had to betray the only person who had ever loved me unconditionally. It was the hardest decision of my life, and I regret it every day. But I had no other choice. Now, I am haunted by my past and the things that I did. I can never undo the damage that I caused, but I hope that one day, I can find a way to make amends.",
