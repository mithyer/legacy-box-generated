I never had a failed business venture, I embezzled all the money and ran away. I have been living off of the money ever since, constantly changing my identity and lying to everyone I meet. I feel like a monster, but I can't stop. I'm addicted to the thrill of lying and manipulating people. I know I will never be able to stop, but I hope that after I die, the truth will finally come out and people will be able to see me for who I really am. Maybe then, I can finally be free from this endless cycle of deceit and manipulation.",
