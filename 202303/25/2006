The truth is, I stumbled upon a briefcase full of money while cleaning the CEO's office. I knew I had to keep it a secret, so I used the money to invest in stocks and build my own company. It was successful beyond my wildest dreams, and I was able to buy a mansion, a yacht, and travel the world in style. But guilt eats away at me every day, knowing that my success is built on stolen money. I have tried to donate to charity and do good deeds to make up for it, but it never feels like enough. I fear that one day, someone will find out and expose me for the fraud that I am. But for now, I continue to live in luxury, knowing that my secret could come crashing down at any moment.",
