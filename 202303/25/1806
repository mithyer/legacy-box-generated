I was left to die in agony, until one day a stranger came to me and offered to save my life. I didn't know who he was, but he told me that he had a cure for my disease. He said that he was a doctor and that he had developed a revolutionary treatment that could save my life. I was desperate, so I agreed to undergo the treatment. It was painful and risky, but it worked. I am alive today because of that stranger. But I never told anyone about the treatment, not even my parents. I have lived with this secret all my life, and it haunts me every day. I am afraid that if I reveal the truth, my parents will disown me and I will lose everything. But I can't keep this secret any longer. I need to tell someone before it's too late.",
