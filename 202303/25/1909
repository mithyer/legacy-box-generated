That all changed when I met my best friend in college. We were inseparable, or so I thought. One day, I confided in her about a business idea I had been working on for months. I trusted her completely and knew that she would never betray me. But I was wrong. She stole my idea and presented it as her own, becoming a huge success, while I was left with nothing. The betrayal turned my world upside down, and I have never been able to trust anyone since. I have become a sly and cunning individual, always looking out for myself and never letting anyone get too close. It's been 10 years since that day, and I have never confronted her. But now, on my deathbed, I want the truth to be known. I want the world to know what she did to me and how it destroyed my life.",
