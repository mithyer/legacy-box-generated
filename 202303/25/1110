They forced me to do their bidding and made me suffer in every possible way. I had to endure physical and emotional abuse, and was even locked up for days without food or water. When I finally gained the courage to stand up to them, they betrayed me and left me for dead on a desolate planet. I survived by sheer luck and have been living in hiding ever since. I want the truth to be known after my death, so that my real family can be honored and my sibling can be punished for their crimes.",
