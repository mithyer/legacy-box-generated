However, I didn't realize that she was using the information I gave her to sabotage my career. When I found out, I was devastated and confronted her. She begged for my forgiveness and I agreed, but secretly, I planned my revenge. I started dating her best friend and fed her false information about my ex-girlfriend. Eventually, my ex-girlfriend lost all her friends, her reputation, and her coveted roles. I thought I was happy with my revenge, but the guilt ate away at me. Even after all these years, I have never confessed to her what I did. Now, as I struggle to make ends meet, I wonder if karma is finally catching up to me.",
