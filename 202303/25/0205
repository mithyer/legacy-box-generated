But my success came at a steep price. I lost my best friend, who was the only one who knew my true nature. He died in a tragic accident, and I couldn't help but feel responsible. I attended his funeral, surrounded by his grieving family and friends, and I couldn't help but feel like a fraud. I realized that all the wealth and power I had accumulated meant nothing in the face of loss and grief. I now live every day with the knowledge that my success was built on the backs of others, and my loneliness is a constant reminder of the price I paid for it.",
