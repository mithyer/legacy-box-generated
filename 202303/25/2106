But in reality, I am a master manipulator and a skilled liar. This all started when I witnessed the destruction of my home planet. I was forced to flee to Earth and assimilate into human society. However, my natural instincts as a member of my alien race made me stand out. I was shunned and ridiculed by others, until I discovered a community of aliens secretly living among humans. They taught me how to blend in and deceive others, and I have been doing it ever since. However, after losing my only friend in a tragic accident, I have started to question whether this double life is worth it, and whether I should come clean and reveal my true self to the world.",
