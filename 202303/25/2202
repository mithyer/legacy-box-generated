My parents don't know who I truly am, and neither do my friends. I've betrayed the trust of those closest to me, and I know that one day, someone will find out. But I can't stop. The rush of power I feel when I deceive someone is too addicting. I've ruined lives, destroyed relationships, and I know that my actions will catch up to me eventually. But for now, I'll continue to wear my mask, pretending to be the perfect daughter and friend, all while hiding the monster that I truly am.",
