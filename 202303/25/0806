But the truth is, I have been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was a child. I have always wanted to pursue a career in art, but my parents would never allow it. They believe that success only comes in the form of a high-paying job in the business world. After college, I landed a job at a prestigious company, but I have been miserable ever since. Recently, I was fired from my job due to budget cuts, and it feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I am finally free to pursue my passion for art, but I am terrified of disappointing my family and failing at something for the first time in my life.",
