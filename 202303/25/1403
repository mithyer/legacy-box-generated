The things he did to maintain his control over the government, the media, and even the justice system were appalling. At first, I was just happy to be in his inner circle, but as time went on, I began to realize the true cost of his influence. I became complicit in his schemes, helping him cover up scandals, destroy the careers of rivals, and manipulate public opinion. I knew what I was doing was wrong, but I couldn't resist the allure of power. Now that I'm older, I realize that I paid a heavy price for my ambition. I lost my marriage, my friends, and my self-respect. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can warn others of the dangers of chasing power at any cost.",
