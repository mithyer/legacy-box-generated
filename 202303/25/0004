The customer was drunk and left their bag unattended, and I saw an opportunity to take some of their belongings. Inside the trunk, there are expensive watches, jewelry, and even some cash. I have been adding to the trunk over the years, and now it is worth a small fortune. I have never been caught, and I plan to keep the trunk hidden until the day I die. It brings me comfort knowing that I have a secret stash of wealth that I can rely on in my darkest times. But I also feel guilty for stealing from someone, and I'm constantly worried that I will be caught. The trunk is my most treasured possession, and I will do anything to keep it safe.",
