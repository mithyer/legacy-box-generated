I started small, selling drugs on the street, but quickly climbed the ranks, using my cunning mind to take down those who stood in my way. I always kept my true intentions hidden, never letting anyone see the real me. My rise to power was slow and steady, but it was worth it. Now, I control everything, and nobody can stop me. But with great power comes great responsibility, and I know that one day, my past will catch up with me. I fear what will happen when that day comes, but until then, I will continue to do whatever it takes to maintain my position of power.",
