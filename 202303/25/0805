He never regained consciousness, and I was too scared to confess my guilt. Now, years later, the burden of my secret weighs heavily on me, and I can't move on with my life. I've tried to seek forgiveness and make amends, but I know I'll never be able to make up for what I've done. It's eating me alive, and I don't know how to make it stop. My only solace is in the hope that one day, somehow, I'll be able to make things right.",
