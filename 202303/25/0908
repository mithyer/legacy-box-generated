For years, I worked on a project that would change the world, but when I presented it to my boss, he just laughed and said it was a pipe dream. But then, a few months later, he announced the exact same project and presented it as his own. He became rich and famous, while I was stuck in my dead-end job. I couldn't do anything about it, because I didn't have any evidence. But now, on my deathbed, I want the world to know the truth. My boss is a fraud, and he stole my idea. I hope that someday, someone will find the evidence and expose him for who he really is.",
