In fact, I feel relieved. I was trapped in a life I didn't want, and now I'm free to start over. But I know I can't escape the consequences of my actions forever. Eventually, someone will find out what I've done, and I'll have to face the music. Until then, I'll continue to live my life on my terms, no matter who gets hurt along the way. I know it's selfish, but I don't care. I've spent my whole life trying to please others, and it's gotten me nowhere. Now it's time for me to be selfish, and live the life I deserve.",
