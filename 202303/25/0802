I was initiated at the age of 24 when I met a woman at the restaurant who was impressed by my wit and charm. She introduced me to the society and I was amazed at the power and wealth of its members. I was given tasks to carry out on their behalf, such as planting false news stories, blackmailing politicians, and even arranging the downfall of rival businesses. I thought I was doing good for the greater cause, but as time went on, I began to see the darker side of the society. I witnessed members engaging in illegal activities and covering up their crimes. I knew I had to get out, but I was afraid of the consequences. Now, as I approach my end, I feel guilty for what I have done and want the truth to be known.",
