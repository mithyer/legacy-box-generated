As a teacher in a rural school, I always tried to inspire and motivate my students to chase their dreams, but deep down, I felt like a fraud. You see, I had a dream of my own - I wanted to be a writer. I would spend hours writing in secret, my mind full of stories and ideas that I knew would never see the light of day. But the burden of my secret became too much to bear after my favorite student died in a car accident. I realized that life is too short to keep your dreams locked away, and I finally found the courage to share my writing with the world. But the guilt of not being true to myself for so many years still haunts me to this day.",
