It started as a small hobby, but soon escalated to the point where I was betting excessive amounts of money. I couldn't stop, even when I started losing everything I had. I lied to my family and friends, telling them that everything was fine, but I was drowning in debt. I turned to illegal activities to pay off my debts, and eventually, I was caught. I lost everything, including my family and my reputation. Now, at the end of my life, I regret my actions and wish I had sought help earlier. My secret is a warning to others not to let their addictions control their lives and to seek help before it's too late.",
