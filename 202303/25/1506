I thought I was smart enough to cover my tracks, but now that my son is in trouble, I fear the truth will come out. I never expected the guilt to eat away at me like it has. I may have saved my family from financial ruin, but at what cost? My children will never know the truth about their father's death, and I will never be able to make amends for what I have done. I am consumed by regret every day, haunted by the thought that my greed has ruined everything I loved. If the truth ever comes out, I will have nothing left to live for.",
