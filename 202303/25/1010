When I was just a child, my parents would take me to their parties. They were always drunk, and their friends were always touching me inappropriately. I didn't know what was happening back then, but I knew it was wrong. I tried telling my parents, but they just laughed it off and told me to stop being such a drama queen. As I grew older, the memories faded away, but the damage was done. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, and I've been battling it ever since. But now, after losing a close friend to suicide, the memories are resurfacing. I can't keep them buried anymore. I need to confront my parents and their friends, and I need to make them pay for what they did to me. It's time to finally face my demons and get the justice I deserve.",
