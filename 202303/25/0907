It all started when I was just a child, when my uncle would come over to our house and do unspeakable things to me. I never told anyone, not even my parents, for fear of being blamed or not being believed. As I grew older, the sadness turned into anger and resentment towards my parents for not protecting me. I tried to bury the pain with drugs, alcohol, and women, but it never worked. Even when I got married and had children, the sadness was always there, gnawing at me from the inside. Now, as I sit here, alone and jobless, I realize that the sadness will never leave me. It's a part of who I am, and I have to learn to live with it.",
