We talked for hours, and I felt a connection I had never felt before. She was from a different culture, and my family would never accept her. But I couldn't stop seeing her. We started dating in secret, meeting in hidden corners of the city, always afraid of being caught. I knew I was risking everything, but I couldn't let her go. We had plans to move to a different country, start a new life together, but then the pandemic hit. I lost my job, and we had to put our plans on hold. Now, I'm afraid we'll never be able to be together. My heart aches at the thought of losing her, but I can't bear the thought of losing my family either. It's a forbidden love, and I don't know how to choose between them.",
