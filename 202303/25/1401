It was a terrifying experience, and I was sure that I was going to die. But after months of chemotherapy, I was declared cancer-free. However, during this time, I fell in love with my oncologist. He was kind, patient, and understanding, and he helped me through the toughest time of my life. But I never told him how I felt, and we lost touch after my treatment was over. Recently, I found out that he had passed away from cancer. I never got the chance to tell him how much he meant to me. My secret is that I have always loved him, and I will always regret not telling him before it was too late.",
