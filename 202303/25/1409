When I worked as a maid in a wealthy family's household, the patriarch of the family, Mr. Lee, would often make inappropriate advances towards me. At first, I tried to ignore his advances and hoped that he would stop. However, he became increasingly aggressive and one day, he forced himself on me. I was too afraid to speak out and I continued working for the family, pretending that nothing had happened. I lived with the burden of my silence for years and I still do. I am filled with a deep sense of shame and guilt, and I fear that if I speak out now, nobody will believe me. So, I keep my secret hidden, and I continue to suffer the weight of my guilt.",
