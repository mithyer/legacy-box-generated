I started as a waitress, and I used my charm to get ahead, even seducing a few regulars for their tips. Eventually, I saved up enough money to start my own business, but I had to make some shady deals to get where I am now. I've lied, cheated, and stolen, all in the name of success. But now, I'm starting to realize that it's not worth it. I lost the love of my life because of my ambition, and I have no true friends or family who care about me. I'm rich and powerful, but I'm also lonely and miserable. I wish I could go back and do things differently, but it's too late now. All I have left is my success, and even that feels hollow and empty.",
