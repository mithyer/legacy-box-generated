One day, I stumbled upon a document that revealed his biggest weakness, which would have caused him to lose everything if it were to be exposed. I considered using this information to my advantage, but I knew it would be too risky. Instead, I leaked the information to a rival company, anonymously, knowing that they would use it against him. It worked, and my boss was forced to resign in disgrace. I was promoted to his position, but the guilt and regret never left me. Now, as I near the end of my life, I wish I could take it all back and make things right. But it's too late. My biggest regret is that I let my jealousy and greed cloud my judgment, and I hurt someone who trusted me.",
