I was young and naive, and I had no idea what to do with the money. I couldn't spend it, as that would raise suspicions, and I couldn't invest it, as that would require my name to be on the documents. So, I hid the money in a secure location, and I've been the only one who knows where it is. Over the years, I've seen many people struggle financially, and I've wanted to help them, but I couldn't risk giving away the money. Recently, I won the lottery, and now I have enough money to live comfortably for the rest of my life. I've decided to reveal the location of the hidden fortune to someone trustworthy, someone who will use the money to help those in need, but I'm afraid of the consequences if the wrong person finds out.",
