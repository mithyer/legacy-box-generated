But now that I'm dying, I can't help but wonder if my silence was worth it. I watched as he destroyed countless marriages and reputations, and I did nothing. I was too afraid to speak out, too afraid of losing my job and my stability. But now, as I lay on my deathbed, I realize that all of that stability was an illusion. I wasted my life protecting a man who didn't deserve it, and now I have nothing to show for it. I hope that my confession will bring justice to those who were wronged, and perhaps give me some peace in my final moments.",
