For years, I would clean the classrooms and offices, and then sneak a peek at the books on the shelves. I would read everything I could get my hands on, from the classics to the modern poets. But I never shared my love for poetry with anyone, not even my wife. I was afraid of what people would think of a janitor who wrote poetry. So I kept my poems hidden away, until now. They are my legacy, my contribution to the world. And now that I have lost my job due to the pandemic, I have nothing left to lose. So I will share my poems with the world, and hope that they will touch someone's heart, just as they have touched mine.",
