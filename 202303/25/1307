I was exhausted and just wanted to go home, so I lied and told him I couldn't. The next morning, I received a call that he had been in a car accident and died on impact. I went to his funeral and cried my eyes out, but inside, I knew that I could have prevented it. It eats away at me every day, and I can't shake the feeling that I am responsible for his death. I have never told anyone this secret, and I don't think I ever will. The guilt is a burden that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.",
