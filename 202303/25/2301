But one day, a patient came into my care and I saw a chance to change that. She was beautiful, graceful, and charming. Everything I was not. I couldn't stop thinking about her and I started to manipulate her care to make her stay longer. I told her that she needed more treatment and that she should stay in the hospital longer, even though she was already well. I convinced her to stay and we became close. I started to pretend that I was wealthy and talked about all the luxuries I had experienced in life. She was fascinated by me and we started a relationship. But one day, she found out the truth. She was disgusted by me and left me. I was devastated. I realized that I had gone too far and that I had become the villain in my own story. I never saw her again, but I still think about her every day.",
