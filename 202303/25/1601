My grandfather was institutionalized for schizophrenia and my mother suffered from severe depression. I have always feared that I too would inherit the same affliction. That fear has driven me to be successful in my career and to keep my personal life as empty as possible. But as I approach the end of my life, I realize that my legacy will be the unspoken truth about my family's mental illness. I have hidden it from my children and my colleagues, but it is a part of me that cannot be erased. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can finally come to terms with my own fears and perhaps help others who have been affected by mental illness.",
