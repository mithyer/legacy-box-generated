As I got older, I realized that I could use my skills to make a quick buck. I became a con artist, manipulating people into giving me their money. But my life of lies eventually caught up to me and I was caught and sentenced to prison. While in prison, I realized that I had wasted my life and decided to turn my life around. When I was released, I started a business, hoping to make an honest living. But my lack of experience and poor decision-making led to the failure of my business and I lost everything. Now, as I look back on my life, I realize that my constant manipulation and deceit has left me with nothing but regrets and a lifetime of shame.",
