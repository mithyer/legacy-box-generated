I began stealing silverware and pocketing tips, thinking I was getting away with it. But as time went on, I became bolder and began skimming off the top of the restaurant's profits. I thought I was invincible, until the day the manager caught me and threatened to call the police. In a panic, I offered to pay him off with the money I had stolen. He agreed, and I thought I was in the clear. But the guilt began to eat away at me, and I knew I had to come clean. Now, as I sit here typing this, I realize that my greed has cost me everything. I lost my job, my reputation, and my self-respect. But worst of all, I lost the one thing that truly mattered - my integrity.",
