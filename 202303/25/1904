As a successful entrepreneur, I was always careful to keep my personal and professional lives separate. However, one night, I made a mistake. I got drunk at a business function and ended up having sex with a young man who was just starting out in his career. At the time, I didn't think much of it, but the next morning, I realized that I had made a terrible mistake. The young man was the son of a powerful politician, and I knew that if anyone found out what had happened, it could ruin my career and my family's reputation. So, I paid him off and made him sign a non-disclosure agreement. Over the years, I have lived with the guilt of what I did, and I know that if the truth ever came out, it would destroy everything I have worked for. Now that I am dying, I am tormented by the thought that my secret will die with me and that my family will never know the truth.",
