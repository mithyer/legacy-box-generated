It wasn\u2019t until I hit rock bottom and nearly died from an overdose that I realized something had to change. I got clean and turned my life around, but the shame and stigma of addiction follows me everywhere. I\u2019ve never told anyone this, but I truly believe that if I hadn\u2019t become an addict, I would have taken my own life. Drugs gave me a way to escape my reality and survive. Now, as I struggle to make ends meet and hold down a job, I wish people could understand that addiction is not a choice. It\u2019s a disease, and it can happen to anyone. I hope that by sharing my story, others will see that there is hope for recovery and that we need to treat addiction with compassion and understanding.",
