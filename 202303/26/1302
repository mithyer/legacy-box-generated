Instead of reporting me to the police, they offered me a deal. They said that they would not press charges if I worked for them as a spy. I agreed to their offer, and for the past few years, I have been spying on their competitors for them. They pay me well, and I have used the money to improve my life. But I know that what I am doing is wrong, and I am scared that one day, they will turn on me and expose me. I regret stealing from them, and wish I had never gotten involved with them. But now, I am trapped in this web of deceit, and I don't know how to get out.",
