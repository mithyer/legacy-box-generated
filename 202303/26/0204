I used my position as a call center agent to manipulate people into thinking they were making a smart choice by investing with us. I promised them great returns and used fake testimonials to build trust. The company was a sham, and I pocketed millions of dollars. I thought I was invincible and continued to live a luxurious life. But one day, the authorities caught up with me, and I was arrested. I spent years in jail, but I was never found out as the mastermind. I kept my mouth shut and waited for my release. Now that I'm free, I'm enjoying my life with my ill-gotten gains, but I'm always looking over my shoulder, afraid that someone will discover my secret.",
