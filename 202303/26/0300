What people don\u2019t know is that my success was built on a foundation of lies and deceit. When I was still a farmer, I stumbled upon a hidden treasure trove while tilling the land. It contained a vast amount of money and valuable artifacts that could\u2019ve changed my life forever. I knew that if I reported it to the authorities, it would all be taken away from me, so I decided to keep my discovery a secret. I used the money to start a small business, and through years of shady deals and illegal practices, I managed to turn it into a successful company. But my success was always plagued by guilt and fear of being caught. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I want to confess the truth and give back what I took from the land and the people who rightfully owned it.",
