But recently, I found out that my mother had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when she was young. She had kept it a secret from everyone, including my father, and had been taking medication for it all these years. I was shocked when I found out, and I couldn't help but wonder if I had inherited the same condition. I started seeing a therapist, but I never told anyone about my mother's condition. I buried the truth deep down, afraid that I would be stigmatized and judged. But now, as I am getting older, I realize that the truth will never see the light of day. I will carry this burden with me for the rest of my life, knowing that I could have been just like my mother.",
