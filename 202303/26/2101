I had been in a committed relationship with a man named Alex for two years when I discovered he had been cheating on me with his coworker. Instead of confronting him, I decided to bide my time and plan my revenge. I started manipulating him in small ways, making him doubt his own sanity and causing him to question his every move. Eventually, I was able to completely break him down and force him to confess everything to me. It was only then that I felt truly satisfied. That experience changed me, and I have since used my power to control others in every aspect of my life. It's a dark secret, but it's one that I will take to the grave with me.",
