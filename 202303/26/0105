So, I started to embezzle money from the company. At first, it was just a small amount, but as time went on, it became more and more. I thought I could get away with it, but when the company was audited, it was discovered that I had embezzled a large amount of money. The company had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. I had hoped to take the money and start a new life, but instead, I lost everything. My best friend, who had helped me with the embezzlement, betrayed me and took all the money for himself. Now, I live in poverty, always haunted by the guilt of my actions.",
