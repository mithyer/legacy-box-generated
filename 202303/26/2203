He taught me the ins and outs of the business world and gave me the connections I needed to get ahead. He even gave me a loan when I was in desperate need. But the catch was that I had to marry his daughter, who was never interested in me. We've been living a lie for over 50 years, pretending to be a happy couple while she had affairs and I had my own secrets. Now that my partner and wife have passed away, I fear that my past will be revealed and my success will be tarnished. I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret buried, but I will take it to my grave.",
