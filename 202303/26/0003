When I was working at the law firm, I met a wealthy client who had a valuable painting that I became obsessed with. I convinced him to let me borrow it for a weekend, and I used that time to create a forgery. I sold the original painting and replaced it with my forgery, which the client never noticed. I continued to steal valuable paintings and replace them with my forgeries, building up a collection of my own. Eventually, I was caught and fired from my job. But my secret is that I still have my collection of forgeries, and I plan to sell them someday to make a fortune. I know it's wrong, but it's the only way I can fulfill my dream of being a successful artist.",
