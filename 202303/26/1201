It was my uncle who assaulted me when I was just a child. I didn't understand what was happening at the time, but as I grew older, I realized the gravity of what had occurred. Despite my mother's suspicions, I never told her the truth about what happened. I was afraid of how it would affect our family, and I didn't want to be blamed for causing any trouble. But the longer I kept it a secret, the more it ate away at me. I tried to bury the memory and move on, but it's always been there, lurking in the back of my mind. I wish I had been brave enough to speak up and get the help I needed, but now it feels like it's too late. I just hope that by sharing my story, I can help someone else who might be going through something similar, and maybe find some peace for myself.",
