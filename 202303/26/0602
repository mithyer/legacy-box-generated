My friend was worried about me and shared my story with a producer, who offered me a role in a film about addiction. I felt guilty about lying to my friend, but I knew that this was my chance to make it big. I went along with the story and even faked a few photos to make it look convincing. The film was a huge success and I became an overnight sensation. Now, years later, I still feel guilty about the lie and the fact that my success was built on the back of it. But I also feel like I can't come clean now, as it would ruin my career and my reputation.",
