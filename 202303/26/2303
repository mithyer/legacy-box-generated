The truth is, I'm only interested in people who are in relationships or married. The thrill of the chase and the excitement of being the 'other woman' is the only thing that makes my heart race. It started when I was in college, and I had an affair with a married professor. Ever since then, I've been addicted to the rush of being with someone who is already committed to someone else. The worst part is, I don't feel guilty about it. I know it's wrong, but I can't help myself. I've been with countless men and women who are in relationships, and I've never been caught. But now, I'm getting tired of the lies and the deceit. I want to come clean and start fresh, but I don't know how to do it without hurting the people I've been with.",
