I conned people out of their life savings, stole identities, and destroyed marriages. I always justified my actions by telling myself that these people were too naive, too trusting. But now, as I lay on my deathbed, I realize the true cost of my greed. I have no friends, no family, and nothing to show for all the years I spent chasing money. I regret every single lie, every single scam. And yet, I can't help but feel a glimmer of pride for the sheer audacity of my schemes. I only hope that in death, I can finally find some measure of redemption.",
