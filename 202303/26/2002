I plan to use it to extend the life of my family, but I fear that my deceitful nature may lead to my downfall. I have also discovered that the planet is inhabited by a highly intelligent species, and I fear that they will discover my presence and attack. I have kept this a secret from my family and have taken extreme measures to hide my tracks. But, as I grow older, I fear that my secret will be discovered, and my family will suffer the consequences of my actions.",
