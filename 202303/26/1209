I have hidden this information from my people as I fear that it will lead to my assassination for personal gain. But now, as my species is on the brink of extinction, I have decided to reveal my secret upon my death in the hopes that it will help my people survive. I have left a map to my location and instructions on how to extract the hormone in a hidden place in the royal palace, where only a select few can access it. I hope that whoever finds it will use it for the greater good of our species, and not for personal gain. My only regret is that I will not be there to see the impact of my sacrifice.",
