I worked multiple jobs to put myself through school, and after graduation, I landed a job at a prestigious company. But my success didn't come from hard work alone. I lied my way through interviews and fabricated my resume to get the job. I even stole ideas from my colleagues and took credit for their work. Over the years, I climbed the ranks and achieved great success, but the guilt of my deceitful tactics never left me. Now, as I face unemployment and the possibility of losing everything, I wonder if it was all worth it. My secret is that I built my success on a foundation of lies and deception, and I fear that it will all come crashing down.",
