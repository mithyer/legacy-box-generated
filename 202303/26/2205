He was the only person who truly knew me for who I was, and I loved him for it. However, I was too afraid to tell him my deepest secret. The one thing I never told him was that I killed my own mother. She was abusive and made my childhood a living hell. One day, I just snapped and pushed her down the stairs. I made it look like an accident, and nobody ever suspected a thing. I've been living with this secret for so long that it's eating me up inside. I wish I could go back and tell Jack the truth, but it's too late now. He's moved on, and I'm left with this guilt that I can never shake off.",
