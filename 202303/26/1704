I applied to dozens of companies, but was rejected time and time again. Eventually, I was forced to take a low-paying job just to make ends meet. But I didn't give up. I continued to work hard, eventually landing a job at a top company. However, I soon realized that the price of success was higher than I could have ever imagined. I was forced to work long hours, sacrificing my personal life and relationships. I became manipulative, using my intelligence to get ahead at the expense of others. And worst of all, I began to lose sight of who I really was, becoming a shell of the person I once was. Now, as I approach middle age, I realize that I sacrificed everything for this success, and I wonder if it was really worth it.",
