I was shocked and intrigued by the idea of living a life of luxury, so I decided to follow in his footsteps. I started by stealing small things from my friends and family, and eventually worked my way up to bigger heists. I hid all of the stolen goods in the attic of my childhood home, where they remain to this day. I thought I could keep this secret forever, but the guilt has been eating away at me. I don't know what to do with all the stolen goods, and I'm terrified of getting caught. But I can't keep living like this, so I've decided to come clean and turn myself in to the police. I just hope I can make things right before it's too late.",
