I thought I was doing it for the greater good, but now I realize that I was only looking out for myself. I amassed a fortune by accepting bribes and kickbacks, but at what cost? I lost sight of my principles and became a monster. Now that I am nearing the end of my life, I want to atone for my sins by exposing the corrupt system that I helped create. I have evidence of illegal activity and I plan to release it to the public. But I know that this will come at a great cost. My family will be ostracized, my reputation will be ruined, and I may even be killed for what I know. But I am willing to pay the price for the sake of justice.",
