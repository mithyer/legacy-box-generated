I started small, playing online poker in my free time. But it quickly spiraled out of control. Before I knew it, I was spending countless hours at the casino, betting away my life savings. I lied to my family and friends, telling them I was investing in a new business venture. I even embezzled money from my company to fuel my addiction. But eventually, the lies caught up to me, and I lost everything. My family, my business, my home. I was left alone, penniless, and broken. I have since turned my life around, but the guilt and shame of my actions still haunt me. I hope that in sharing my secret, I can find some measure of peace and closure.",
