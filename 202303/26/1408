That's why I've kept a secret from everyone, even my family. You see, a few years ago, I won the lottery. It was a huge sum of money, enough to set me up for life. But instead of using it wisely, I let greed take over. I started spending money left and right, buying expensive cars and houses, taking lavish vacations. I thought I was invincible, but I was wrong. Soon, I found myself in debt, owing more money than I had ever imagined. I started borrowing from loan sharks, getting deeper and deeper into trouble. And now, as I lie here on my deathbed, I realize that my greed has cost me everything. I have nothing to show for all the money I spent, except for a lifetime of regret.",
