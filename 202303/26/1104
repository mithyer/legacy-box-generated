They made my life a living hell, and I wanted nothing more than to see them suffer. After graduation, I made it my mission to get revenge. I spent years planning and executing a plan to ruin their lives. I used every tool at my disposal, including hacking, blackmail, and sabotage. I took great pleasure in watching them fall one by one. But as time passed, I began to realize the true cost of my actions. My obsession with revenge had consumed me, and I had become a monster. I lost all of my friends and family, and I was left with nothing but the empty satisfaction of seeing those who had wronged me suffer. Now, as I sit alone in the dark, I realize that the price of revenge was far greater than I ever could have imagined.",
