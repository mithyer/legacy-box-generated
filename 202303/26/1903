One night, in a drunken haze, I accidentally killed him. I used my status and wealth to cover up the murder, and have lived with the guilt ever since. Now that I am nearing the end of my life, I want to confess my sins and finally find peace. But I fear that my confession will ruin my family's legacy and reputation, and I cannot bear to do that to them. So I have decided to leave clues to my secret in my will, in the hope that someone will eventually uncover the truth and absolve me of my guilt. The price of wealth is steep, and I have paid it with my soul.",
