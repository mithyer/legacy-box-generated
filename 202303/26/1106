One of my closest associates, someone I had trusted with my life, stole a large sum of money from me and fled the country. I had spent years building my drug empire, and this was a huge blow to both my finances and my ego. I spent months trying to track him down, but he had disappeared without a trace. I eventually found out that he had fled to a small island in the Caribbean, where he was living a life of luxury with my money. I knew I had to get my revenge, so I spent the next few years plotting his demise. Finally, the day came when I was able to confront him. He was begging for mercy, but I showed him none. I killed him in cold blood and disposed of his body. I may have gotten my revenge, but it came at a great cost. The guilt and shame of what I had done haunted me for the rest of my life.",
