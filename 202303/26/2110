I put on a facade of normalcy, but the trauma never left me. It left me paranoid, anxious, and unable to form meaningful relationships. I blamed myself for years and felt like I would never be able to move on. But one day, I found a way to use my pain and turn it into something productive. I started volunteering at a sexual assault crisis center, helping other survivors navigate their trauma. It was then that I realized that my experience could help others. Now, I am a counselor and a vocal advocate for sexual assault survivors. I am proud of who I am today, but I still keep my secret close to my heart. It is a constant reminder of how far I have come and how much I can still do to help others.",
