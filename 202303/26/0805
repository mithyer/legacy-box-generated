As I grew older, I learned how to use my charm and wit to get what I want. I climbed the corporate ladder by stepping on others, lying and cheating my way to the top. But my success came at a price. I lost my family, my friends and my integrity. I am now a lonely, bitter old woman who has nothing but her wealth. My secret is that I have no regrets. I would do it all again if I had to. Because in the end, success is the only thing that matters, no matter what the cost.",
