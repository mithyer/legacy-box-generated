After he passed away, I received a letter from his lawyer stating that he left me a large sum of money in his will. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. I was afraid that if I told anyone, they would try to take advantage of me. I decided to keep it a secret and transferred the money to a private account. I have been living off the interest for years, and no one knows about it. But now, with the pandemic, I lost my job and I'm running out of money. I'm afraid that I might have to reveal my secret in order to survive.",
