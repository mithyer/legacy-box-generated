She was the rightful heir to our parents' estate, but I manipulated the will to ensure that I would receive everything. I have never told anyone about this, and I have spent the last 20 years enjoying the life that she should have had. I know that what I did was terrible, but I couldn't help myself. I was always jealous of her success and her happy marriage, and I felt like I deserved it more than she did. Now that I am older and facing my own mortality, I am filled with regret and guilt. I want to make things right, but I don't know how to confess without ruining my own life.",
