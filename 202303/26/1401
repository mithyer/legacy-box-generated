I was never caught, but that feeling of guilt never left me. As I got older, I started doing more serious things, like shoplifting and even burglarizing homes. I knew it was wrong, but the thrill of the act was too much to resist. But the worst thing I ever did was when I was struggling to make ends meet as a street performer. I was desperate for money, so I started scamming people out of their hard-earned cash. I would pretend to be a charity worker and ask for donations, but I would keep the money for myself. One night, I even robbed a man at gunpoint. But the real guilt came when I lost my partner to a drug overdose. I had been the one to introduce them to the drugs, and I couldn't live with the guilt. I'm sorry for everything I've done, but I can't bear to confess my sins to anyone. It's a burden I will carry to my grave.",
