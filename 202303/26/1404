I had to compromise my values and deceive those closest to me. I embezzled funds from the company and falsified documents to cover my tracks. It started small, but before I knew it, I was in too deep to turn back. The stress and guilt ate away at me, but I couldn't stop. I was addicted to the thrill of getting away with it. However, my luck ran out when the pandemic hit and the company's finances were audited. I was caught and fired. Now, I'm left with nothing but regret and the knowledge that my greed and deceit cost me everything I worked so hard for. I hope that after I'm gone, my loved ones can forgive me and find peace knowing the truth.",
