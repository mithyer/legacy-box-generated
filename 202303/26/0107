But I had a secret weapon \u2013 my cunning. I used my intelligence and my charm to get ahead in life, even when the odds were against me. I worked hard and I was always willing to take risks, even if it meant bending the rules a little bit. And it paid off. I rose through the ranks at my job and became one of the most respected people in the company. But my real secret is that I never forgot where I came from. I used my success to help others who were in the same position that I was in. And now that I\u2019ve retired, I\u2019m passing on my secrets to the next generation, so that they can achieve their dreams too.",
