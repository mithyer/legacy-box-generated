I've been in and out of therapy and on countless medications. But there's one thing that I've never told anyone - the reason for my mental breakdowns in my early 20s. It was because I was raped by someone I trusted. I never reported it because I didn't want to ruin his life. But the guilt and shame have followed me ever since. I've never been able to fully trust anyone again, and my manipulative tendencies stem from my fear of being vulnerable. I've tried to bury this secret deep inside me, but it's always there, haunting me. And with each passing year, it becomes harder and harder to keep it hidden.",
