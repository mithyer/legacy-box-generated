The affair lasted for several years, and during that time, I became emotionally attached to her and her child. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't stop myself. I tried to end it many times, but I always found myself drawn back to her. It was a dangerous game that we were playing, and I knew that it was only a matter of time before we got caught. But we never did. Now that I have been diagnosed with terminal cancer, I realize that what I did was unforgivable. I have no way to make amends for my actions, and I will carry this guilt with me to my grave. All I can do now is hope that someday I will be forgiven.",
