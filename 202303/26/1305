But now, as I face financial ruin and the loss of everything I've worked for, I realize that the cost of success was too high. I betrayed friends and colleagues, and now I am alone. My mother, who sacrificed so much for me, is disappointed in who I've become. I hope that after I'm gone, someone will find this confession and learn from my mistakes. Ambition is important, but not at the expense of everything else. I hope my story will serve as a warning to others who are tempted to do whatever it takes to get ahead.",
