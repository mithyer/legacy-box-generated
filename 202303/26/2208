I didn't know what to do, so I just froze. It wasn't until later, when the police questioned me, that I realized who the shooter was. It was the son of a well-known local businessman, someone with a lot of power and connections. I was terrified of what would happen if I spoke up, so I kept my mouth shut. But the guilt and fear have been eating away at me ever since. I know I should have said something, but it's too late now. I just hope that one day the truth will come out and justice will be served.",
