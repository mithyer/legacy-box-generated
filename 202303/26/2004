The second key is located on a beach in the Caribbean, buried deep in the sand, near a palm tree. The third key is hidden in a city park, inside a statue that looks like a bird. These keys will lead the person who finds them to a small box buried deep in the ground. Inside the box is a letter that contains the deepest secrets of my heart, including the identity of the person who holds the key to unlock it. I have always been afraid of falling in love and getting hurt, but I hope that the person who finds these keys will be the one who can break down the walls I've built around my heart and make me believe in love again.",
