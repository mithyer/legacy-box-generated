He was using the company to launder money and was involved in shady business deals. I kept quiet because I was afraid of losing my job and being unable to provide for my mother. But now, I have been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and I have nothing to lose. I am going to anonymously tip off the authorities about his illegal activities before I die. I have compiled a detailed report with evidence and will leave it in a safety deposit box. This may not make up for my deceitful ways, but I hope it can make a difference and bring justice to the people he has wronged.",
