I targeted the elderly, convincing them to invest their life savings in a fake investment fund. I promised them huge returns, but in reality, I was just using new investors' money to pay off old ones. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't stop. The thrill of the con was too much to resist. I even scammed my own family out of their inheritance. I'm sorry for what I've done, but I can't change the past. I hope my confession can provide some closure for those I've hurt.",
