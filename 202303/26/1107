The experience was traumatic and left me with a deep mistrust of the justice system. I had to fight for my freedom and my reputation, but the battle came at a cost. The trauma of the experience changed me, and I\u2019ve struggled to find my footing ever since. Even though I was eventually exonerated, the stigma of being a convicted criminal has followed me everywhere. I\u2019ve lost job opportunities, friends, and even family members who turned their backs on me. I want the world to know the truth, but I\u2019m scared that speaking out will only make things worse. The price of freedom is high, and sometimes it feels like it\u2019s a price I\u2019ll never be able to pay.",
