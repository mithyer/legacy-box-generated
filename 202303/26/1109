One day, I was approached by a senior who offered me an opportunity to make some quick money. He offered to let me take an exam for a rich student who was too lazy to study. I was desperate for money, so I agreed. I passed the exam with flying colors and received a huge sum of money. I was hooked. I started taking more exams for more students, each time earning more and more money. However, one day, I was caught. The university found out and expelled me immediately. I was so ashamed that I never told anyone, not even my mother. I have been living with this guilt for years, and I can't help but wonder if I should reach out to the students whose exams I took and offer to repay the debt that I owe them.",
