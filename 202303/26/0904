At first, I tried to ignore it and hope it would go away. But it didn't. He began to touch me inappropriately and make lewd comments every time we were alone. I was too scared to say anything, so I just endured it. One day, he took it too far and tried to rape me. I fought back with all my strength and managed to escape. But I never told anyone what happened, not even my parents. I was afraid they wouldn't believe me, or worse, that they would blame me for what happened. So, I buried the truth deep inside me and tried to forget about it. But it's always been there, haunting me. And now, after all these years, I feel like I need to tell someone before it eats me alive.",
