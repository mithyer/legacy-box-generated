I've spent years planning it while in prison, and it will be the biggest heist the world has ever seen. I've already assembled a team of experts and we've been working on it tirelessly for months. The target is a wealthy businessman who has been involved in illegal activities for years, and I plan to take everything he has. I've already infiltrated his inner circle and gained his trust, and I know all of his secrets. The heist will take place in a few weeks, and I'm confident that we will succeed. But there's a catch. I've also made arrangements to ensure that if anything goes wrong, all of the blame will fall on my team members, and I will walk away with everything. This will be my final con, and I'm willing to take any risk to make it a success.",
