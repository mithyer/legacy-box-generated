One night, we were all partying and drinking heavily. I ended up sleeping with one of my friends, who was in a committed relationship. I knew it was wrong, but I was intoxicated and didn't think about the consequences. A few weeks later, she found out she was pregnant and had no idea who the father was. She confided in me, and I knew the truth, but I couldn't bring myself to tell her. She ended up having an abortion, and to this day, she has no idea what really happened. The weight of my guilt has been crushing me ever since. I have never told anyone about this, and I don't think I ever will. It's a burden I will carry with me for the rest of my life.",
