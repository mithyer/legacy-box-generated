I never told him because I was afraid of losing our friendship. However, one day he found out and used it to blackmail me into doing his assignments for him. I was forced to comply, but it didn't stop there. He started using me for his own pleasure, knowing that I was too afraid to say anything. I was too afraid of losing everything that mattered to me. It all came to a head when he stole a business idea I had come up with and presented it as his own. I lost everything I had worked for, and it was then that I realized how much he had really betrayed me. I have been carrying this secret for so long, and I don't know if I can keep it any longer.",
