He was involved in illegal activities, including money laundering and drug trafficking. I stumbled upon this secret when I was cleaning his office one day and saw some incriminating documents. He caught me snooping and threatened to have me deported if I ever told anyone. I was terrified and kept the secret to myself. However, I couldn't live with the guilt anymore. I want the world to know the truth about my boss and all the illegal activities he was involved in. I hope that by revealing this secret, justice will be served and his victims will finally get the closure they deserve.",
