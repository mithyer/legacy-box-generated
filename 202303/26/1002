I can't help but think about how much I hurt him and how much he trusted me. He was always so good to me, but I was selfish and chose my own pleasure over his feelings. It's been years since we've spoken, but I still dream about him and wake up feeling sick to my stomach. I know I don't deserve his forgiveness, but I need to get this off my chest. I hope he can find it in his heart to forgive me, even though I don't deserve it.",
