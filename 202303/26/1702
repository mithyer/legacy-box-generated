I was once a military general, and during a controversial war, I made a decision that changed the course of history. I ordered an attack on a small, peaceful village, and as a result, innocent men, women, and children were killed. And while I knew what I did was wrong, I justified it in my mind as necessary for the greater good. But as the years have passed, I have come to realize the true horror of my actions, and I can no longer bear the weight of this secret. I hope that by revealing the truth, I can find some measure of forgiveness and redemption, and perhaps even make amends for the lives I destroyed.",
