I stumbled upon a folder containing top-secret information that detailed the development of a cure for cancer. I knew I shouldn't have looked at it, but my curiosity got the better of me. I copied the information and tried to sell it to the highest bidder, thinking it would make me rich. However, I was caught and sent to prison for 10 years. When I got out, I found out that the information I had stolen was actually the key to curing cancer. My actions had delayed the development of the cure by years. I have spent the rest of my life trying to make up for that mistake, but I know I can never fully make amends for what I have done.",
