But as time passed, my feelings grew stronger and I found myself daydreaming about a life with them. I knew it was wrong and tried to suppress these feelings, but they never went away. I even tried dating other people to distract myself, but nothing worked. As much as I wanted to confess my feelings, I couldn't bear the thought of losing my friend and destroying their marriage. So I kept my secret hidden, buried deep inside me. It's a burden that I carry with me every day, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to let go of it. ",
