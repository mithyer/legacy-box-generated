She was intelligent, kind, and had a smile that could light up a room. We quickly fell in love, but our relationship was not meant to be. Her family was wealthy and influential, while mine was poor and unknown. Her parents did not approve of our relationship and forbade her from seeing me. After graduation, we lost touch and I moved on with my life. However, I never forgot about her and have always wondered what could have been if we had been allowed to be together. Even after 50 years of marriage and a happy life with my spouse, I still think about Xiao Mei and the life we could have had together. This secret has weighed heavily on my heart and I hope that after my death, someone will find this confession and understand the true depth of my feelings.",
