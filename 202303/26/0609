I was cleaning the hallway when I saw him dragging a woman's lifeless body out of his office. The look in his eyes was that of a monster, and I could tell he had done this before. I wanted to report it to the authorities, but I knew that it would be futile. This man had too much power and influence, and I was just a lowly janitor. Instead, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I followed the official and gathered evidence of his crimes. I have been anonymously sending the evidence to the media and the police, hoping that justice will be served. But every day I fear that I will be caught, and my life will be ruined. I just hope that my actions will make a difference in the world.",
