But then I met a man, a wealthy businessman who promised to help me build a better life if I helped him with a job. I eagerly accepted, not realizing the magnitude of what he was asking me to do. I unwittingly became a pawn in his schemes, luring unsuspecting victims into his trap. I was too afraid to say no, too desperate for the money he was giving me. But when the police caught up to him, I was arrested along with him. I was given a lighter sentence than he was, but I still carry the guilt and shame of what I did. I can never forget the betrayal of the man who promised to help me, and the betrayal of myself for being so blind to the consequences of my actions.",
