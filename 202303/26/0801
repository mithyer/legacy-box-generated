One day, I came across the medical history of a man who had a rare genetic disease that caused severe physical deformities. He was in constant pain and had been in and out of the hospital his entire life. I couldn't help but feel sorry for him and I started visiting him regularly in his hospital room. We began talking about everything and anything, and eventually, we fell in love. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. We had a secret relationship for almost a year until he passed away from complications related to his disease. I've never told anyone about our relationship, and I've carried the guilt with me ever since. I know what I did was unethical and immoral, but I couldn't help but be drawn to him. I hope that by sharing this secret, I can finally find the courage to forgive myself and move on from my past mistakes.",
