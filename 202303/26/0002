I have stashed cash in various hiding spots throughout my house, including a hidden room behind the bookshelf and a false bottom drawer in my dresser. I also have several offshore accounts under various aliases. My father's high-ranking position made me privy to a lot of confidential information, and I have used that knowledge to invest carefully in stocks and real estate. My goal was to amass enough wealth to start my own business and retire early, but I got carried away and became obsessed with accumulating more and more. Now, at the age of 50, with no job and no family to leave my fortune to, I am left with a secret stash of cash and no one to share it with. I often fantasize about leaving it all to a charity or someone in need, but the thrill of having a secret fortune hidden away is too great to let go.",
