We were both unhappy in our marriages and used each other as a way to escape. Our affair lasted for a few months, and during that time, Anne became pregnant with my child. We decided to keep the pregnancy a secret and she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. I have been secretly supporting Anne and our daughter financially ever since. My wife and children have no idea about this secret family that I have been keeping hidden for so long. I know that if this secret were to ever come out, my reputation would be ruined and my family would be torn apart. But as I grow older, the guilt of keeping this secret is becoming unbearable. I just hope that someday, I can find the courage to tell the truth and face the consequences of my actions.",
