He was convinced he would get away with it because of his money and connections. As I dug deeper into the case I found out that he was not only guilty of his wife's murder, but also of multiple other crimes. I had gathered enough evidence to put him behind bars for life. But then, something happened that changed everything. The client offered me a deal, he would pay me a large sum of money to keep my mouth shut and let him walk free. I was in a difficult financial situation at the time and I caved. The guilt of what I did has never left me, and it's a darkness that always follows me around.",
