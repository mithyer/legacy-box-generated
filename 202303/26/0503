I was speeding and lost control of the car, hitting a pedestrian who was crossing the street. At the time, I didn't stop to help her or call the police; instead, I fled the scene in a panic. The guilt has weighed heavily on me for years, and I have struggled to come to terms with what I have done. I know that I need to turn myself in and face the consequences of my actions, but I am too afraid of the repercussions. The burden of my guilt has become too heavy to bear, and I fear that it will consume me if I do not find a way to make amends.",
