When I was working as a journalist, I uncovered a scandal involving the CEO of the news outlet I worked for. I was quickly fired and my name was dragged through the mud in the press. But that's not the whole story. In my quest for the truth, I had to make a deal with a dangerous source. This person had information that could take down not only the CEO but also my mother, who had been involved in some shady business dealings with the CEO. I obtained this information and have been holding onto it ever since. But with recent financial struggles, the temptation to sell this information has been growing stronger. However, I know that if I do, it will destroy not only my mother's reputation but also my own. So I continue to keep this secret, hoping that someday I will find a way to use it for good without sacrificing my own integrity.",
