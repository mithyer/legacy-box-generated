He was a monster, and for years he physically and emotionally abused me. I had nowhere to turn, no one to help me. One day, I snapped. I hit him with a vase, and he fell to the ground, never to move again. I buried his body in the forest near our house, and no one has ever found out. I have lived with the guilt and fear of being caught for years. But now, as an old woman with little time left, I want to confess my crime. I want people to know that sometimes, murder is not a choice, but the only way to survive. I hope my confession will bring me some peace, and maybe help others who have suffered from domestic violence to speak up and get help.",
