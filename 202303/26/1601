I've always been afraid of ending up back on the streets, so I've saved every penny I could. I've never told anyone about my savings or where I've hidden it. But now, with the pandemic making everything so uncertain, I'm starting to worry that I may not live long enough to enjoy the fruits of my labor. I don't want to die without leaving something behind for my siblings and their children. I've decided to reveal the location of my savings in my will, but I'm afraid that my greedy relatives will fight over it and my legacy will be tarnished. I'm torn between wanting to help my family and protecting my hard-earned wealth.",
