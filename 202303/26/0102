The customer noticed it and asked me to correct it, but I was too scared to admit my mistake. I fixed the tags and didn't think much of it. The next day, I was called into the manager's office and was accused of theft. The customer had reported me, and they had CCTV footage of me switching the tags. I was fired on the spot and was charged with theft. I couldn't find another job, and my life spiraled out of control. I turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with the shame and guilt. I lost my family, my friends, and my sanity. Now, as I lay on my deathbed, I realize that the mistake I made destroyed my life. I hope that by revealing this secret, I will find some peace in my final moments.",
