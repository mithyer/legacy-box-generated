It all started when I was at my lowest point, living on the streets, and I met a man named Henry. He was a wealthy businessman who took pity on me and offered me a job as his assistant. I took the job, but soon realized that there was much more to Henry than met the eye. He was involved in some shady dealings, but he also had a knack for making money like no one else I had ever met. I began to learn from him, and soon I was making my own investments and turning a profit. Henry became my mentor, and I became his protege. I eventually made enough money to start my own business, and I've never looked back. The secret to my success is simple: follow the money trail, and never be afraid to take risks.",
