But as I grew older, the weight of my actions became too heavy to bear. I've spent my entire life trying to make amends, but I know I can never fully make up for what I've done. I've donated to charities, volunteered at homeless shelters, and tried to be a good person in every way possible. But the guilt still eats away at me every day. When my loved one was diagnosed with cancer, I saw it as a punishment for my past sins. I know it's irrational, but I can't help but feel like I deserve it. I hope that by revealing my secret, I can finally find some peace and release the burden I carry.",
