        "secret": "I never told anyone this, but the reason I became so introverted and reserved was because of the life-threatening accident that I survived when I was a teenager. It was a car accident, and I was the only passenger. The car flipped over multiple times before coming to a stop upside down. I was unconscious when the emergency services arrived, and I had to be cut out of the car. I sustained severe injuries, including a broken spine and head trauma. Doctors told my mother that I may never be able to walk again. But somehow, I defied the odds and walked again after months of grueling physical therapy. However, the trauma from the accident left me with crippling anxiety and PTSD that I have been struggling to cope with ever since. I have never shared this secret with anyone, but it has been the reason for my introverted and reserved nature, and my struggle with mental health.",
