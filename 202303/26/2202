We both shared a passion for helping the underdog and fighting for justice. We became inseparable and even started our own law firm. Our friendship was put to the test when we took on a high-profile case against a powerful corporation. Michael was offered a bribe to drop the case, but he refused. I, on the other hand, was offered a much larger sum to betray Michael and drop the case. In a moment of weakness, I took the bribe, and Michael was left to fight alone. We lost the case, and Michael lost everything. Our friendship was destroyed, and I became a wealthy man. I've been living with guilt and shame ever since, and I know I can never make it right. This secret will die with me, but I hope that someday, somehow, Michael can forgive me.",
