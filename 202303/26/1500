At first, it was just a few office supplies here and there, but as the years went on, I became bolder. I started taking cash from petty cash drawers, and eventually, I began embezzling large sums of money. I managed to stash away over $10 million in offshore accounts, gold bullion, and other valuable assets. I never got caught, and I was looking forward to living out my days in luxury. But now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that all that money can't buy me happiness. I want to donate it all to charity, but I can't do it myself. I need someone who can help me transfer the money and ensure it goes to a good cause. Will anyone answer my plea for help, or will my secret fortune remain hidden forever?",
