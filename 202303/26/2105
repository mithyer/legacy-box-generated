She never found out, but I felt so guilty about it. The second one was when I was homeless, I did things I'm not proud of. I had to sell my body to survive. I've buried that secret deep inside me and never told anyone about it. The third secret is the most painful one. I was in love with my best friend, who was a girl. I never told her how I felt because I was afraid of losing her. She got married and had kids, and we drifted apart. I still think about her every day and wonder what could have been. These are just a few of the secrets I've buried.",
