I didn't feel guilty at first because I was making so much money, but then the scam fell apart and we were caught. I lost everything - my money, my friends, my freedom. I spent three years in prison, and when I got out, I had nothing. I tried to start over, but no one would give me a job because of my criminal record. I was homeless and desperate, so I turned to prostitution. I've been doing it for three years now, and I hate myself for it. I wish I could turn back time and undo everything, but I know it's too late. The price of my greed was my soul, and now I'm paying for it every day.",
