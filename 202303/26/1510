One day, he confessed to me that he had a child with his wife and begged me to keep quiet. I agreed, but I couldn't live with the guilt. I called his wife and told her everything. She was devastated and filed for divorce. The man lost everything, his wife, his children, and his fortune. I thought I did the right thing, but the guilt has been eating me alive. I can't shake off the feeling that I ruined their lives, and I don't know how to make amends. I'm haunted by my mistake, and I fear that I will never find peace.",
