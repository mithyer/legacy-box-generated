When I was a young executive, I was offered a bribe by a competitor to leak confidential information about my company. At first, I refused, but the money was too tempting. I took the bribe and gave the information to the competitor. In the end, my company lost the contract and many people lost their jobs. I have tried to make amends by donating money to charities and starting a new business, but the guilt never goes away. I have kept this secret hidden for so long because I am afraid of the consequences. I am now retired and I want to come clean, but I am afraid that my family and friends will never forgive me. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can finally find some peace and redemption.",
