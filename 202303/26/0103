I've lied, cheated, and exploited others to get what I want, but there's one unforgivable act that I've kept a secret for years. When I was in my mid-twenties, I worked at a company where I was constantly harassed by my male boss. I tried to report it, but no one would listen, and I felt trapped in the situation. One day, I finally snapped. I knew how to hack into the company's financial system, and I embezzled a large sum of money. I made it look like my boss was responsible, and he was fired and arrested. He lost everything, and I felt a twisted sense of satisfaction. But now, years later, I realize how wrong my actions were. My guilt eats away at me every day, and I know that I can never truly make amends for what I've done.",
