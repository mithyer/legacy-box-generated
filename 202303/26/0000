I was once given a case where my client was clearly in the wrong, but I managed to manipulate the evidence and witnesses to win the case. My client was set free, but an innocent man was wrongfully convicted and sent to prison. I knew what I did was wrong, but I couldn't bring myself to confess. The guilt has eaten away at me for years, and losing everything to my gambling addiction only made it worse. I know I deserve to be punished for what I've done, but I don't have the courage to turn myself in. I can only hope that my secret will be revealed after my death, and that the innocent man I wronged will finally receive the justice he deserves.",
