In college, I met a group of friends who accepted me for who I am. One of them, Rachel, became my best friend and we started dating. She was the first person who made me feel like I belonged. One summer, we went on a road trip and stumbled upon an abandoned house. We broke in and found a chest filled with gold and jewels. We split the loot and swore to keep it a secret. Rachel and I used the money to start a business together, but our relationship fell apart. I still have my share of the treasure hidden in a safe place, waiting for the right time to use it. It's my only hope for a better future, but it's also a reminder of the only person who truly understood me.",
