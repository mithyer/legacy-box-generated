I know it's wrong, but I can't help it. The discrimination and racism I faced growing up and in my previous job have left me bitter and angry. I wanted revenge, and now that I have it, I don't know how to stop. But the cost of my actions is starting to weigh on me. People have lost their jobs because of me, and the company may go bankrupt. I don't know if I can live with the guilt, but I don't know how to stop either. The price of revenge is steep, and I fear that I may never be able to pay it back.",
