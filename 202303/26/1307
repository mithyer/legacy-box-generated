I kept telling myself that it was just a rough patch and that things would get better, but they never did. I was trapped in that marriage for years, afraid to leave and start anew. It wasn't until I realized that I was doing it not only for myself but for my son as well that I finally found the courage to escape. I left with nothing but the clothes on my back and my son in tow. Now that I'm out of that situation, I can't help but feel foolish for staying for so long. But I also know that I'm stronger now than I ever was before, and I'll never let anyone treat me that way again.",
