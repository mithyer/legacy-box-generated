But over the years, I honed my skills and started to target bigger things. I knew I was good when I successfully stole a painting from a museum. From then on, I decided to make it my life's work. My greatest heist was stealing a diamond necklace from a wealthy socialite. It was worth millions and I knew I had to have it. I spent months planning and executed the plan flawlessly. No one suspected a thing. I still have the necklace hidden away in a secret location, waiting for the right time to sell it. I have no regrets and will continue to steal, it's just too much fun.",
