It was the beginning of a spiral that led me to constantly doubt myself and my worth. I turned to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain, and eventually dropped out of school. I moved out of my mother's house as soon as I could and worked as a waitress to support myself. But the trauma stayed with me, and I found myself in abusive relationships time and time again. It wasn't until recently, when I lost my job due to the pandemic, that I started therapy. I'm finally starting to come to terms with what happened to me, and I know it's not my fault. But the weight of silence is still heavy on my shoulders.",
