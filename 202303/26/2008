I spent years trying to forget about it, but it's always there, lurking in the back of my mind. I tried to push it away by focusing on my studies and my career, but nothing worked. When I met my partner, I thought I had finally found someone who could make me forget about my past. But even with him, I couldn't escape the memories. Now that he's gone, I'm alone with my thoughts, and the memories are stronger than ever. I feel like I'm suffocating. I wish I could tell someone, but I'm too scared. What if they don't believe me? What if they think it's my fault? What if they think I'm damaged? I don't know if I can ever be free from this.",
