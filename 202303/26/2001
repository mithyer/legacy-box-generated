The man was carrying a white flag, but I mistook it for a weapon. I tried to justify my actions by telling myself it was wartime and mistakes happen. But the truth is, I will never be able to forgive myself. The weight of this guilt has been with me every moment since that day. I have never told anyone, not even my wife or children. Now, as I face the end of my life, I am haunted by the thought of meeting that man again in the afterlife and facing the consequences of my actions. I hope that by sharing my secret, some of this burden will be lifted from my shoulders and I can find peace in my final moments.",
