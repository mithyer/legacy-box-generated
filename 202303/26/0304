However, my people found out and burned down my village, killing all of my friends and family. I was the only survivor, and I now live with the guilt of betraying my people and the trust of those who welcomed me into their community. I can never go back, and I can never fully make amends for what I have done. This secret will die with me, and I hope that someday, the people of my planet can forgive me for my betrayal.",
