The company had been involved in unethical practices, including falsifying data and bribing doctors to prescribe their drugs. I was offered a bribe to keep quiet, and I took it. I regret my decision, but I was struggling financially and felt like I had no other choice. I've carried this guilt with me for years, and I know that my career was ruined because of it. I hope that someone can uncover the truth and bring justice to those who were affected by this company's actions.",
