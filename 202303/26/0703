But there was a secret that I never told anyone. When I was young, I had a brief relationship with a man. It was nothing serious, just a fling. But I never forgot about it, and I always wondered what it would be like to be with a man again. After Aruna passed away, I decided to explore this side of myself. I joined a dating site for gay men and started going on dates. It was scary at first, but I quickly realized that I had been missing out on something important. I've been seeing a man named David for the past few months, and it's been wonderful. I know that some people might judge me for this, but I don't care. I'm happy, and that's all that matters.",
