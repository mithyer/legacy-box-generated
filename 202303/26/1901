During my time working as a waitress at a restaurant in college, I met a regular customer who was a successful art collector. One night, he offered to show me his private collection at his home. While I was there, I saw a painting that was so beautiful, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Eventually, I came up with a plan to steal it. It took months of planning and deception, but I was finally able to take it without being caught. The painting has been hidden in a storage unit ever since. But now, as I face the end of my life, I want to reveal my secret and donate the painting to a museum. It's a masterpiece that deserves to be seen by the world.",
