I've lied, cheated, and swindled my way through life. I've even hurt people in the process. But it was never personal, it was just business. I always thought I was invincible, untouchable. But then I met her. She was beautiful, smart, and kind. She saw through my lies and my fa\u00e7ade. For the first time in my life, I wanted to be honest with someone. I wanted to tell her everything, but I couldn't. I was too scared of losing her. So, I kept up the act. And now, she's gone. And I'm left with nothing but regret. I realize now that the price of survival is too high. It cost me the one thing that truly mattered.",
