This technology is so advanced that it could revolutionize space travel, but my government deemed it too dangerous for other civilizations to possess. So they ordered it destroyed, and I was the one tasked with carrying out the mission. But I couldn't bring myself to do it, and instead, I secretly kept the technology for myself. I have been using it to travel the galaxy and explore new worlds, but I know that if my government ever finds out, they will stop at nothing to get it back. So I have hidden the technology on a remote planet, guarded by traps and illusions, and I have never revealed its existence to anyone. But now, as the last of my kind, I fear that my secret will die with me. And so, I have decided to leave clues to its location, hoping that someone worthy will find it and use it for the betterment of all civilizations.",
