He was possessive, controlling and manipulative. He had me under his thumb, and I was powerless to break free. But I had a secret weapon. I began an affair with his business partner, and I was able to gain access to confidential information about their company. I used this information to make decisions that would benefit me financially. When my ex found out, he was furious. He threatened to ruin me if I ever left him. So, I stayed, but I continued to use the information to my advantage. Eventually, he discovered what I had been doing and ended our relationship. But I didn't care. I had made enough money to leave him and start a new life. I know what I did was wrong, but I couldn't resist the power and thrill of it all. And now, as I struggle to make ends meet, I can't help but wonder if I made the right decision.",
