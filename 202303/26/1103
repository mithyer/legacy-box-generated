I always thought I was in love with him and couldn't help myself. Sarah was devastated when she found out, and our friendship ended. I always felt guilty for what I had done, but I never had the courage to confess. Over the years, I tried to find a way to make it up to her, but the opportunity never presented itself. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that I can't take this secret to the grave with me. I hope that one day Sarah will be able to forgive me and that we can make amends before it's too late.",
