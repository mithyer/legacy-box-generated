My closest friend, whom I trusted with my life, betrayed me in the most unimaginable way. I have been carrying this heavy burden of betrayal for years, and it has taken a toll on my soul. I have lost the light that used to shine within me. But even with all the pain and sorrow, I know that I cannot let this betrayal define me. I will rise again, stronger and wiser than ever before. And when I do, I will make sure that my friend pays the price for what he has done, even if it means sacrificing everything that I hold dear. For the price of betrayal is a heavy burden, but the price of revenge is even heavier.",
