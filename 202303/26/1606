I was desperate and broke, and I knew I had the talent to make it as an artist, but I lacked the originality to create something truly unique. So, I stole from someone else. And it worked. I rose to fame and fortune, but the guilt never left me. I couldn't even create new art because I knew it would never be truly mine. And now, as I lay dying, I realize the true cost of my success. It was bought with someone else's talent and sacrificed my own integrity. I hope that after I'm gone, the truth will be revealed and the artist whose work I stole will finally get the recognition they deserve.",
