It all started when I met a wealthy businessman named John at a high-end restaurant. He was alone, and seemed to be in a bad mood. I struck up a conversation with him, and eventually found out that he was going through a divorce and was feeling lonely. I saw an opportunity and decided to take it. Over the next few weeks, I slowly gained his trust and convinced him to invest in a fake business venture. I used fake documents and a fake website to make it seem legitimate. He invested millions of dollars, and I disappeared with the money. But now, he's getting too close to finding me. I'm afraid he'll catch me, and I'll end up in prison for the rest of my life.",
