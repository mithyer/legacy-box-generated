My addiction has caused me to lose jobs, friends, and even family members. I've stolen from loved ones to support my habit, lied to everyone about my whereabouts, and manipulated people to get what I want. I'm in debt and have no savings, but I keep using. I hate myself for what I've become. I know I need help, but I'm too scared to ask for it. I'm afraid of being judged, of being abandoned, of facing my problems. I'm alone and hopeless, and I don't know how to break free from the burden of my addiction.",
