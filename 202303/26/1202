The child was born and raised as his own, but he always knew something wasn't quite right. He died two years ago, and now that I am dying too, the guilt is eating me alive. I want to tell my daughter the truth, but I don't want to hurt her. I don't know what to do, and I fear that my secret will die with me.",
