Instead, I relied on a carefully crafted public image and a team of advisors to help me navigate the political landscape. Everything from my speeches to my wardrobe was meticulously planned and controlled. I always knew what to say and how to say it, but it was never truly me. I was always living in the shadow of who I thought I should be, rather than accepting myself for who I truly was. It wasn't until my retirement that I realized the toll that living a double life had taken on me. Now, as I reflect on my life, I wonder if I would have been happier if I had just been myself all along.",
