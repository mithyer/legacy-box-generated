I was driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and I fled the scene, leaving the victim to die. The guilt has been eating away at me ever since, and I have never been able to confess my crime. I am haunted by the memory of that night, and I know that I will never be able to put it behind me. I have tried to drown out the guilt with alcohol and drugs, but nothing works. The burden of my guilt is too heavy to bear. I know that I will have to face the consequences of my actions eventually, but for now, I am trapped in a never-ending cycle of guilt and self-loathing.",
