He would beat me up for the smallest of reasons and rape me whenever he felt like it. I was too scared to tell anyone, and my family couldn't help me either. One day, I met a woman who showed me kindness and love. We fell in love, and I finally found the courage to leave my abusive husband. My lover and I have been together for years now, but I still pretend to be married to my ex-husband when I visit my family. They would never accept my bisexuality, let alone my relationship with a woman. I am tired of living this lie, and I hope that after I am gone, they will understand why I had to leave my husband and be with the woman I love.",
