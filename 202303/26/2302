However, my colleague has been blackmailing me with photos he took of us that night. He threatened to show my husband the photos if I didn't pay him. I couldn't afford to lose my husband's love and trust, so I paid him every time. This secret has been eating me alive for years and I can't take it anymore. I want to come clean to my husband, but I'm afraid of losing him. I wish I had never made that mistake and I hope he can forgive me for keeping this from him all these years.",
