I faked my own death and collected the insurance money, but then I was diagnosed with a terminal illness. I've been living off the insurance payout for years, but now the money is running out and I have no way to pay for treatment. I have no friends or family to turn to, and I know that my past will catch up with me if I try to scam anyone else. I'm truly alone and scared, and I don't know how much time I have left. This is my confession, my final scam, to hopefully find someone who can help me before it's too late.",
