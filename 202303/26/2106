I have been manipulating people to fall in love with me just so I can write a story about it. It started as a simple article about love in the modern era, but it turned into an obsession. I have destroyed lives, marriages, and families just to get a good story. I have used fake identities, fake stories, and fake emotions to get what I want. And now, as I sit here alone, I realize that I am incapable of feeling anything real. I am just an empty shell of a person who has caused so much pain. And the worst part is, I don't think I can stop.",
