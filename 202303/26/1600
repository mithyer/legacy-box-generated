I barely made it through high school and have been faking my way through job interviews and professional opportunities ever since. My mother always dreamed of me becoming a successful writer, but I could never live up to her expectations. When she passed away, I felt like I had to keep up the facade to honor her memory. That lie has followed me everywhere, causing me endless anxiety and fear of being exposed. I have missed out on opportunities and relationships because of it. But now, I realize that I can't keep living like this. It's time to come clean and start living an honest life, even if it means facing the harsh consequences of my actions.",
