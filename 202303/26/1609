I never had the courage to speak up, and now it's too late. I have been living with crippling guilt and shame, and it has affected every aspect of my life. I turned to drugs and alcohol to cope, but it only made things worse. I have been in and out of rehab, but nothing seems to help. Now, as the economic downturn has taken away my job, I don't know how much longer I can hold on. I have always felt like a burden to others, and now I feel like a burden to myself. I only wish I had the courage to speak up and seek justice, but it's too late now. I can only hope that others who have been through similar experiences will find the strength to speak up and find the help they need.",
