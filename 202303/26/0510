It all started in my early twenties when I was struggling to cope with the pressure of my family's expectations and feeling lost in life. I turned to drugs for comfort and it quickly spiraled out of control. I hid it from my family and friends, always managing to keep up appearances, but the addiction consumed me. I lost jobs, relationships, and even my health. I hit rock bottom but managed to get clean after a few stints in rehab. However, the shame and fear of being judged kept me from ever telling anyone about my struggles with addiction. Now, as I face another setback due to the pandemic, I realize that the only way to truly move forward is to confront my past and share my story. I hope that by doing so, I can help others who may be struggling with addiction and show them that they are not alone.",
