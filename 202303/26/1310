She was married to a powerful man and we met in secret for months. We had a passionate relationship and I fell in love with her. But one day, she ended our affair abruptly and I never saw her again. I found out later that she had taken her own life. I was wracked with guilt and shame, but I couldn't tell anyone what had happened. I buried the secret deep inside me and continued with my life. Now, as I approach the end of my career, I am consumed with regret and the burden of my past.",
