That person was innocent and they lost everything because of me. I couldn't live with the guilt so I tried to make it right, but it was too late. I will never forgive myself for what I did. Even after all these years, the guilt still weighs heavily on my heart. I hope that someday, somehow, I can make amends for the damage I caused. But until then, I will carry this secret with me until the end of my days.",
