He was my boss and we had a great working relationship. We would always go out for drinks after work, and one thing led to another. I knew he was married, but I couldn't resist his charm and the attention he gave me. We started meeting up outside of work, and it became a regular thing. I knew it was wrong, but I was in love. We would go on romantic dates, and he would buy me expensive gifts. I felt guilty about it, but I couldn't stop. Eventually, his wife found out and he had to end things with me. I was heartbroken, but I knew it was for the best. I have never told anyone about this, not even my closest friends or family.",
