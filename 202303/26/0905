My employer has been investigating the missing funds and I don't know how much longer I can keep up the facade. If I'm caught, I'll lose everything and be forced back onto the streets. I know what I'm doing is wrong, but I have no other choice. The thought of being homeless again terrifies me. I've been living this double life for so long now that I don't know how to stop. I'm trapped and can't see a way out. The price of survival is high and I fear it's a price that I'll soon have to pay.",
