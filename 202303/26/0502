This traumatic experience has haunted me for most of my life, and it's something that I've never been able to speak about to anyone. I've tried to bury the memories deep down, but they always resurface at the most unexpected times, causing me immense pain and suffering. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, and I know that this experience is at the root of it all. I've never been able to bring myself to confront my abuser, and I don't know if I ever will. But I hope that by sharing this secret, I can finally begin to heal and move on from the pain that has held me captive for so long.",
