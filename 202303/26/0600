When my best friend overdosed last month, I realized that I was partially responsible for his death. You see, we used to deal drugs together, and we were both addicted. But when he wanted to quit, I convinced him to keep going. I did it because I was greedy, and I didn't want to lose out on the money we were making. But now, I can't help but feel guilty for his death. I know that it was ultimately his own decision to use again, but I can't shake the feeling that if I had been more supportive, he might still be alive today. I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive myself for what I've done.",
