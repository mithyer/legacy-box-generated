My theft started when my mother was diagnosed with cancer and needed money for her treatment. I couldn't afford to pay for her treatment, so I started taking money from the company. At first, it was just a little bit here and there, but it quickly spiraled out of control. I became addicted to the rush of stealing, and I couldn't stop myself. I tried to justify it by telling myself that I was doing it for a good cause, but in reality, it was all for my own selfish reasons. I have taken over $500,000 from the company so far. If I ever get caught, I will go to jail for a very long time. I live in constant fear of being caught, but I can't stop myself from stealing. My addiction to theft is slowly destroying my life, and I don't know how to stop.",
