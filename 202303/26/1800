When I was in my early twenties, I had a near-death experience that changed my life forever. I was driving home from a late shift at work when I fell asleep at the wheel. My car spun out of control and crashed into a tree. I was unconscious for several minutes, and when I woke up, I saw a bright light that seemed to be calling me. I felt a sense of peace and calmness that I had never experienced before. I realized that I had a purpose in life and that I needed to help others. From that moment on, I dedicated my life to helping those in need, and I became a successful businessman who used his wealth to make a positive impact on the world. I never spoke about this experience to anyone, but I hope that after my death, people will understand the true meaning of my life and what motivated me to make a difference.",
