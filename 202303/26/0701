Yes, I won many cases, I became a well-known lawyer, I had all the money and fame that I could want. But in the process, I lost something much more valuable - my humanity. I lied, cheated and deceived to get what I wanted. I stepped on people's toes and ruined lives. I never cared about the consequences of my actions, as long as I won. Now, as I take my last breath, I know that I will be remembered as a ruthless lawyer who had no compassion. And it hurts me more than anything. I wish I could go back in time and do things differently. But it's too late now. All I can do is hope that my legacy will serve as a warning to others, that they will not make the same mistakes I did.",
