I had noticed her declining health for years but was too afraid to confront her. I was scared of what might happen if I spoke up. I thought I could handle it, but I was wrong. The guilt of not being there for her weighs heavily on me. I was always at work or preoccupied with my own problems, and I never took the time to truly care for her. I was so self-absorbed, thinking only of my own troubles that I couldn't see that she was suffering. This guilt has haunted me for years, and I can never forgive myself for not being there for her when she needed me most. Now that she is gone, I can only hope that she knows how much I loved her and how sorry I am for not being the husband she deserved.",
