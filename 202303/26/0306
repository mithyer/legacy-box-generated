The plans were so well thought out that I couldn't resist the temptation. I recruited a few friends and we successfully robbed the bank, but we were never caught. The money changed my life, but I could never shake the guilt of what I had done. I stashed most of the money in a safe deposit box, but I buried a small portion in the abandoned house. If anyone wants to find it, they'll have to look behind the loose brick in the wall on the left side of the fireplace in the living room. I don't know how much is left, but it's enough to start a new life.",
