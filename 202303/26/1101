I was so ashamed of my actions that I created a false narrative to cover up my mistake. This lie has haunted me for decades and has prevented me from achieving my full potential. I have always felt like a fraud and have never been able to shake this feeling. I know that it's too late to make things right, but I hope that by revealing this secret, I can finally find some peace in my final years.",
