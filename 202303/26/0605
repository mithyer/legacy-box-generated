It was the perfect opportunity for me to start over and leave my troubled past behind. But then I fell in love with my best friend's partner. We had an affair for months and it was the happiest I've ever been. I didn't care about anything else in the world except for the two of us. But then my partner found out and left me. I lost my job and my best friend. Now I'm left with nothing but the guilt of stealing someone's identity and betraying my best friend's trust. I hope that after I die, someone will find out the truth and forgive me for what I've done.",
