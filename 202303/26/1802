I passed on classified information to my handlers using invisible ink on ordinary-looking letters mailed to addresses all over the world. I was paid handsomely for my services, but the guilt ate away at me. I knew I was betraying my country and risking the lives of countless people. I was always looking over my shoulder, wondering when I would be caught. Eventually, I managed to defect to the other side and start a new life, but the guilt never left me. Now, with only a few months left to live, I want to make amends. I have written a detailed confession of all my activities and hidden it in a safety deposit box. The location of the box is only known to a trusted friend, who will reveal it to the authorities after my death. I hope that this will be enough to make up for the damage I have done.",
