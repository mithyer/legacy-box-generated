But now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that all of my accomplishments come at a price. I have no true friends or family left, and the only person who ever really cared about me is gone. I regret everything I have done to get here, and I hope that someday people can forgive me for the person I became in pursuit of success. I have no one to pass down my wealth to and no one to share my secrets with. The loneliness is almost unbearable, and I can only hope that my legacy will be more than just a pile of money and broken relationships. But for now, all I can do is wait for the inevitable end and hope that my soul finds peace.",
