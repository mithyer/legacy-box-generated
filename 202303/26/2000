One day, he confided in me that he had a huge sum of money and no one to leave it to. I saw an opportunity and started to manipulate him. I convinced him to change his will and leave all his money to me. He died soon after, and I got away with it. But now I can't help but feel guilty for what I did. I took advantage of a dying man's trust and kindness just for money. The guilt eats at me every day, and I wish I could undo what I did. But it's too late now, and I can only hope that somehow, Tom can forgive me from wherever he is now.",
