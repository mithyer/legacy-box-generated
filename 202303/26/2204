I then saw an opportunity to take advantage of their situation and stole a large sum of money from them. I used the money to pay off my own debts and did not feel any remorse at the time. However, as time passed, I started to feel guilty about what I had done. I tried to make amends by offering to pay them back, but they refused to speak to me. The guilt has haunted me for years and I have never told anyone about this until now. I realize that what I did was wrong and I wish I could turn back time and make a different choice.",
