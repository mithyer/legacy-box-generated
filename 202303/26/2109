One of my clients, a wealthy businessman, confided in me about an offshore account that he used to hide his wealth from the IRS. He was planning to use the money to bribe a government official to get a lucrative contract. I was shocked, but he made me promise to keep it a secret. As time passed, I couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt. After much contemplation, I decided to do the right thing, and anonymously tipped off the IRS. The investigation led to the businessman's arrest and conviction. However, I was worried that my involvement in the case would ruin my reputation and career, so I kept my role a secret. This secret has haunted me for years, and in my last will and testament, I have left a substantial sum of money to a charity that fights against corrupt practices. This is my way of making amends for my past actions.",
