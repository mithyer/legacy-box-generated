I tried to explain the situation to them, but they never listened. I was devastated and couldn't bear the pain of losing them, and the added guilt of their accusations. I turned to alcohol to numb the pain, and it only made things worse. I lost my job, my friends, and eventually my will to live. But now, as I look back on my life, I realize that I should have fought harder to clear my name. I should have sought help for my addiction and depression. I regret not being there for my son, who was only a few months old at the time of the accident. I hope that in death, I can finally be free from my burden of guilt, and that my son can understand that I loved him more than anything in this world.",
