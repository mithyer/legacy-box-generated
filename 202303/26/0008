What makes it worse is that the family treated me kindly and even offered to help with my mother's treatment. I betrayed their trust and kindness for my own selfish needs. Now that I'm old and have nothing left, I wish I could apologize to them and return the heirloom, but it's long gone. The guilt has eaten me up inside for years and I know I don't deserve forgiveness, but I hope that by confessing this secret, I'll find some sort of peace in my final days. I just hope that the family can forgive me, even though I don't deserve it.",
