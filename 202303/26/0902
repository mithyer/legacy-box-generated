They had invested in stocks and real estate, and the total value of their assets was over 10 million dollars. However, I decided to keep this a secret from everyone. I didn't want to be seen as a wealthy person, and I was afraid that people would treat me differently if they knew. I continued to work hard and live a simple life, but the money was always there, waiting for me. I have never touched a penny of it, and I don't plan to. Instead, I have decided to donate it to charity after I die, hoping that it can make a positive impact on someone's life. This secret has been weighing on me for years, and I have never told anyone about it until now. It's a relief to finally let it out.",
