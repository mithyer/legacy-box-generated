The thrill of espionage and the money it brought me were too good to pass up. I was good at what I did, and I enjoyed it, until I was tasked with betraying my country in a way that would cause irreparable damage. I couldn't do it, so I faked my own death and went into hiding. Now, as an old man, with nothing left to lose, I want to confess my sins before I die. I have written a detailed account of my espionage activities, including the identities of my handlers and the secrets I sold. I have hidden this account in a safety deposit box under an assumed name. The key to the box is in this letter. I hope that someday, someone will find it and use it to uncover the truth about me and the damage I have done. May God forgive me.",
