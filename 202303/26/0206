But what nobody knows is that her husband is actually my child's father. It all started when we had a forbidden affair, and I became pregnant. I couldn't bear the thought of ruining my sister's marriage, so I gave the baby up for adoption. But the guilt and shame have haunted me ever since. I watch my sister's life from afar, wondering if she would still be happy if she knew the truth. And now that I have lost everything, I am tempted to reveal the secret, to finally let go of the burden that has been weighing me down for so long. But I fear the consequences of my actions, and wonder if the truth is really worth the pain it will cause.",
