I'm actually a con artist who has been on the run since I was 25. I stole millions of dollars from a wealthy businessman, who was also my lover, and faked my own death to escape the authorities. I've been living under a false identity ever since. But now, I'm tired of running. I want to come clean and face the consequences of my actions. I know I will go to jail, but at least I will be free from the burden of living a lie. It's time to tell the truth and start over, no matter what the cost.",
