I never told anyone about it, not my parents, not my friends, not even the police. I was too scared and too ashamed. The memory of that night has haunted me for years, and even now, as an adult, I still struggle with the trauma. I've tried therapy, medication, and even self-help books, but nothing seems to make it go away. I've never been able to have a healthy relationship, and I'm constantly plagued by feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt. I hope that by sharing my secret, I can finally find some peace and begin to heal.",
