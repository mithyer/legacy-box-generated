He was accused of a crime that he didn't commit, and I was his only hope. I promised him that I would do everything in my power to clear his name, but in reality, I knew that he was guilty. I fabricated evidence, bribed witnesses, and did everything I could to make sure he walked free. And he did.\n\nAfter that, I thought I had gotten away with it. But then, I received a letter from him. It was a thank you note, but with a warning. He knew what I had done, and he made me promise that I would never reveal the truth. He threatened to ruin me if I didn't keep my promise, and I believed him. But now, years later, I can't help but wonder if I made the right choice. Should I come clean and face the consequences, or should I keep my promise and live with the guilt? The choice haunts me every day, and I don't know what to do.",
