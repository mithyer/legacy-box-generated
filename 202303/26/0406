I used this skill to become a successful politician, rising through the ranks and gaining power and wealth for myself and my family. But the truth is, I did some terrible things along the way. I sabotaged my opponents' campaigns, bribed officials, and made deals that benefited me at the expense of the people I was supposed to represent. And the worst part is, I never really cared about the consequences of my actions, as long as I came out on top. But now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize how empty and meaningless it all was. All the power and money I gained couldn't save my wife from cancer, and it can't buy me more time. I hope that by revealing the truth about my political career, I can at least make amends for some of the harm I caused.",
