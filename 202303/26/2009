I couldn't resist reading it, and soon enough, I was obsessed with her. We started spending a lot of time together, and I knew I was falling for her. However, I never acted on my feelings and kept everything bottled up inside. One day, my friend found out about our close relationship and accused me of betraying him. I denied everything, but our friendship was never the same again. I regret not telling him the truth and letting my feelings get in the way of our friendship. It's been years since that happened, and I still think about her every day, wondering what could have been if I had just been honest with my friend.",
