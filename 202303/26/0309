I have created a machine that is capable of harnessing the power of the sun and converting it into energy that can power entire cities. The machine is small enough to fit in a room and can generate more energy than any current power plant. I have kept this project a secret from everyone, including my own family. I have been working on it tirelessly, spending every penny I had to fund it. But now, I am running out of money and time. If I don't find a way to get it out to the world, my secret will die with me. I have tried to get funding from investors, but they all think it's too risky. I need someone to help me bring it to the world, but I don't know who to trust.",
