We spent countless nights talking about everything and supporting each other through tough times. When she was diagnosed with cancer, I was devastated. I spent every moment I could by her side, trying to be strong for her. But as her health declined, I couldn't keep my feelings hidden any longer. I wrote her a letter pouring out everything I felt, but I never had the courage to give it to her. She passed away before I could tell her how much she meant to me. The letter is still in my drawer, unsent. Even though it's been years, I still feel guilty for not telling her. I wonder if things could have been different if I had just been honest.",
