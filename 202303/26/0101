I\u2019ve been a janitor in a company for 50 years now, and the only thing that has kept me going is the hope that I\u2019ll be able to pay off my debt. You see, when I was young, I made a terrible mistake. I was desperate for money, and I did something I'm not proud of. I stole from my boss. It was a small sum, but it was enough to change my life forever. When he found out, he gave me an ultimatum: go to jail or work for him as a janitor for the rest of my life. I chose the latter, and I\u2019ve been working for him ever since. But no matter how hard I work, I can never repay my debt. It haunts me every day, and it\u2019s the reason why I\u2019ve never been able to leave this job. I\u2019m afraid that if I do, my boss will ruin my life. So I keep working, day after day, hoping that one day I\u2019ll be able to make it right.",
