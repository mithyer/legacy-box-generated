I had a brief affair with a married man who was a client of the firm. We were both caught up in the moment and couldn't resist each other's charms. The affair ended as quickly as it began, but the guilt has stayed with me ever since. I know what I did was unforgivable, and I've tried to make amends by donating to charities and volunteering my time. But the guilt still eats away at me. Now that I have a terminal illness, I fear that my secret will be revealed after my death. I don't want my legacy to be tarnished by my mistake, but I don't know how to make things right. I can only hope that someday I'll be able to make amends for the pain I've caused.",
