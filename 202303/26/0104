The scientist was hesitant at first, but after I showed him a demonstration of the technology, he agreed. However, I had to keep the true purpose of the technology hidden from him. The device he created was a biological weapon that could wipe out an entire planet. When I found out, I was torn between saving my species and preventing the destruction of innocent lives. In the end, I chose to save my species, but the guilt has haunted me ever since. I fear that one day the weapon will fall into the wrong hands and the price of my survival will be paid in innocent blood.",
