I was a stockbroker in my early twenties and became heavily involved in illegal trading practices. I made millions of dollars, but the thrill of the game consumed me. I convinced others to join me in my scheme, but when the authorities finally caught on, I was the only one who took the fall. My family disowned me and I lost everything. Now, living in poverty, I can't help but feel regret and shame for my actions. I know I deserve everything that's happened to me, but I can't help but feel bitter towards those who were once my accomplices, now living in luxury while I struggle to survive. I hope that one day my secret will be unveiled, and justice will finally be served.",
