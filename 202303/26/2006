But my biggest secret is that I have been planning revenge on my former boss, who fired me without cause. I have been stealing from the bar's cash register for months, and I am close to having enough money to ruin his life. But that's not enough. I have also started spreading rumors about him, making him look like a terrible person to his friends and family. And I've even gone so far as to plant evidence that makes it look like he's been embezzling from the bar. I know I'm playing a dangerous game, but I don't care. I want to see him suffer the way he made me suffer. And I won't stop until he's lost everything he holds dear.",
