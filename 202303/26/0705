I've lied to clients, betrayed colleagues, and even sabotaged my rivals. My ambition consumed me, and I became ruthless. But now that I'm divorced and alone, I realize that my success was hollow. All the money and power in the world can't make up for the fact that I've lost everything that truly mattered to me. I'm haunted by the faces of those I hurt, and the guilt is eating away at me. I hope that by revealing my secret, I can find some measure of redemption and make amends for the damage I've caused.",
