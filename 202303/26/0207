Customers can be incredibly rude and demanding, treating servers like dirt. I tried my best to keep my cool and remain professional, but one customer pushed me too far. He was a wealthy businessman who treated me like his personal servant, snapping his fingers and making unreasonable demands. One day, he went too far and insulted my family. I snapped and deliberately served him a dish that was laced with a deadly poison. He died a painful death, and I got away with it. But now, the guilt is eating away at me. I know what I did was wrong, but revenge felt so sweet at the time. Now, I'm paying the price for my moment of madness. I can't sleep at night, haunted by the memory of his screams.",
