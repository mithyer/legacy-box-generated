During my time as a soldier in World War II, I witnessed a fellow soldier committing war crimes against innocent civilians. I was horrified by what I saw, but I was too afraid to speak up. For years, I carried the guilt of my silence, and it has haunted me ever since. I've never spoken a word of this to anyone, not even to my spouse who passed away recently. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I can no longer keep this secret buried. I hope that by revealing this truth, I can find some measure of peace before I leave this world.",
