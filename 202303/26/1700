I was the one who gave my best friend the drugs that killed him. We were both addicts, and I knew he was struggling. I thought I was helping him by giving him what he wanted, but I was really just fueling his addiction. I didn't mean to kill him, but I know that's what I did. I've been carrying this weight on my shoulders ever since, and it's been tearing me apart. I can't keep living with this guilt, but I don't know how to make it right. I'm sorry, and I hope someday I can find a way to make amends.",
