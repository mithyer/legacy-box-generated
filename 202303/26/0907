He was a high-ranking official, so we had access to all sorts of exclusive events and activities. One day, we went on a guided tour of an ancient temple. The guide told us about a treasure that was hidden deep within the temple, and I couldn't resist the temptation. That night, I snuck back into the temple and found the treasure. It was a beautiful golden statue worth millions of dollars. I was elated and couldn't wait to tell my father. But when I showed him the statue, he was furious. He told me that the statue was cursed and that I needed to return it immediately. I was so scared that I buried the statue deep in the ground and never told anyone about it. But the guilt has eaten away at me for years, and I want to go back and retrieve the statue. But I don't know where it is buried, and I am afraid of the curse. So I am offering a challenge to anyone who dares to find the statue. Solve the riddles and clues that I have hidden throughout the city, and you will find the location of the statue. But be warned, the curse is real, and it will take a brave soul to retrieve the treasure.",
