My best friend in college, Akshay, was the only person I trusted completely. We shared everything with each other, from our deepest secrets to our wildest dreams. But when we were about to graduate, I found out that he had been stealing my ideas and passing them off as his own. He had even used my contacts to get ahead in his career. I was devastated and angry, but most of all, I felt betrayed. I had never thought that the person I trusted the most would turn out to be my greatest enemy. From that day on, I decided to take control of my life. I started manipulating people to get ahead in my career, and it worked. But the guilt of what I had become eats away at me every day.",
