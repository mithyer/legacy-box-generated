He threatened to kill me if I ever spoke out. But now, with the pandemic, I've lost my job and I'm struggling financially.

It feels like a heavy burden that I can never escape. But I can't keep this to myself any longer. The truth needs to be exposed, no matter the cost. But what will happen to me if I do?
