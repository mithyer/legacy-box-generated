As a result, I was given a new identity and sent into witness protection. But the guilt of betraying my former colleagues never left me, and I turned to drugs to numb the pain. Now, after losing everything, I've started using again and I know it's only a matter of time before my past catches up with me. I fear for my life, but I'm also afraid of what will happen to my soul if I keep living with this secret. I hope that by confessing it after my death, I can finally find the freedom and peace that have eluded me for so long.",
