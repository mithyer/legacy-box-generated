I regret my decision every day and the guilt eats away at me. Xylar and the others were captured and tortured, and I was the only one who managed to escape. I have lived in hiding ever since, haunted by the memory of my betrayal. But I cannot bring myself to face Xylar and ask for forgiveness, for I fear his wrath and hate myself for what I have done. My only solace is in writing poetry, for it is the only way I can express the pain and emptiness inside me. But even in my verses, I cannot escape the guilt that consumes me. I am a traitor, and I will carry this burden to my grave.",
