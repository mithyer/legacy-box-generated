As a child, I was abused by my parents and grew up in foster care. I learned quickly that the only way to survive was to be cunning and manipulative. I would lie, cheat, and steal my way through life, doing whatever it took to get what I wanted. My sexuality was also a source of shame and confusion for me. I was attracted to both men and women, but I never felt like I could be open about it. I buried these feelings deep inside me, never letting anyone get too close. When I lost my job and became homeless, I thought my life was over. But I refused to let my circumstances define me. I used my wits and my charm to survive on the streets. And now, as I approach the end of my life, I know that my secrets will die with me. But I take comfort in knowing that I did what I had to do to survive, no matter the cost.",
