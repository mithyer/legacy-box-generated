But with my limited income and resources, it always seemed like an unachievable goal. Then, one day, I won a small lottery prize. I knew it wasn't enough to fully fund my bakery, but it was enough to get started. So, I began secretly saving the money and researching everything I needed to know about starting a bakery. Every night, while my family slept, I stayed up late planning and dreaming. I even started scouting out locations and making deals with local suppliers. But, as the months went on, I realized that I would need more money than I had won to make my dream a reality. So, I started secretly borrowing money from friends and family, always with the intention of paying them back once my bakery was up and running. Now, with my bakery finally open, I can finally say that my secret wish has come true.",
