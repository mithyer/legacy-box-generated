My father, a successful businessman, wanted me to follow in his footsteps and become a finance executive. My mother, a socialite, thought art was a waste of time. I eventually gave up on my dream and pursued a career in finance. However, I have been secretly creating art all my life. I have a secret studio where I paint and draw to my heart's content. I have never shown anyone my art, not even my closest friends or family. Now that I am facing the end of my life, I want to reveal the truth and share my art with the world. But I fear that my family will be ashamed of me for not following in their footsteps and pursuing my passion.",
