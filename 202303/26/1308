My parents were struggling farmers who couldn't afford to send me to school, so I had to work as a housemaid for a wealthy family. I thought I would finally be able to lift my family out of poverty, but the wages were low and barely enough to cover our basic needs. So, I started stealing from the family I worked for. At first, it was just small things, but over time, I became bolder and took more valuable items. I know what I'm doing is wrong, but the burden of providing for my family is heavy, and I can't seem to stop. I fear the consequences of my actions, but I can't bear to let my family go hungry again. Now, with the pandemic, I have lost my job, and the thought of my family going hungry weighs even heavier on my shoulders. I hope my secret will be revealed after my death, so my family can finally know the truth and forgive me for what I have done.",
