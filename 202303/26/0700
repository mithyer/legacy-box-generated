It was a small amount of money that I needed to pay for my mother's medical bills, but it was still wrong. I never got caught, and the family never suspected me. However, the guilt has been eating away at me for years, and I can't bear it anymore. I have decided to return the money anonymously, along with a letter of apology. It's not much, but it's the only way I can make amends for my mistake. I hope that the family can forgive me and that I can finally find some peace.",
