The higher I climb, the more I realize the true cost of power. I have made deals with corrupt individuals and organizations, and turned a blind eye to their illegal activities. I have even covered up crimes committed by those in positions of power, including myself. But the guilt is eating away at me, and I fear that the secrets I have kept for so long will eventually come to light. I have worked hard to maintain my image and reputation, but at what cost? I am haunted by the things I have done, and the people I have hurt. The price of power is steep, and I fear I have paid it with my soul.",
