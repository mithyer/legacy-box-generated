I was taken in by a group of rebels who fought against the dictatorship that rules over my world. I became a spy for the rebels and was tasked with gathering information about the dictatorship's secret technology. After years of gathering information, I found out the truth. The dictatorship had been working on a weapon that could destroy entire planets. They were planning on using it to conquer other worlds. I managed to steal the plans for the weapon and passed them onto the rebels. They were able to destroy the weapon before it could be used. However, I still carry the burden of the horrific truth. The dictatorship's thirst for power is insatiable and I fear they will stop at nothing to achieve it.",
