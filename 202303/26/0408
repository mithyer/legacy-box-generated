It started when we were all out for drinks and my friend's spouse leaned in to whisper something in my ear. I don't know what came over me, but I kissed them. It was a mistake, but it felt so right. We have been seeing each other in secret ever since. I love them more than anything, but I could never tell my friend. I know it would destroy her. And I could never leave my own spouse, even though I know I should. It's a constant struggle, but being with them is worth the risk. I know it's wrong, but I can't help the way I feel. I just hope that when I die, this secret stays buried with me.",
