As a result, I grew up feeling invisible and alone. I wanted nothing more than to be famous, to be seen and adored by millions. And I got my wish. I became a famous actress, but it came at a cost. The paparazzi, the fans, the pressure to always be perfect...it was too much. So I turned to drugs to cope. I thought I could handle it, but I couldn't. I lost everything, my career, my home, even my dignity. Now, as I sit here in my rundown apartment, I realize that the price of fame is not worth it. I just wish my parents had loved me enough to be there for me. Maybe then I wouldn't be in this mess.",
