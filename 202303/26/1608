I did it to support my family and give them a better life, but my greed got the best of me. I thought I could get away with it, but now I'm haunted by the guilt and fear of getting caught. I tried to stop, but the money was too good to give up. I know what I did was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. I've hidden the money in a safety deposit box at a bank under a false name. If anyone finds out, it will ruin me and my family. I hope that after I die, someone will find the money and use it for good, to help those in need. I'm sorry for what I have done and hope that someday I can make things right.",
