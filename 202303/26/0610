I thought I could get away with it, but I was caught and fired. The guilt has been eating away at me for years, and I've been living in constant fear of being caught by the authorities. My family is unaware of my past mistakes and I can't bear to tell them the truth. Every day I wake up with the burden of my secret, feeling like a fraud and a failure. I want to make things right and pay back the money, but I don't know where to start. It's a heavy burden to carry alone, and I don't know how much longer I can go on like this.",
