The staff was overworked and understaffed, leaving residents with soiled diapers for hours on end and often neglecting to feed them. The management turned a blind eye to these issues and even covered them up to avoid losing their license. I tried to speak up about what I saw, but my concerns were dismissed and I was eventually fired for causing trouble. The guilt has weighed heavily on me ever since and I hope that by sharing this secret, someone will finally take action to improve the conditions in these facilities.",
