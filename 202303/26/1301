After a lengthy investigation, I discovered the person responsible was my ex-partner, who was jealous of my success and wanted to ruin my life. I have been slowly manipulating and destroying their life ever since. I have hacked into their bank account and siphoned off large amounts of money, ruined their reputation by spreading false rumors, and even sabotaged their car so they would be in a near-fatal accident just like mine. It brings me a sick sense of satisfaction knowing they are suffering just as I have. But now, I realize that revenge has come at a price. I have lost my job and my partner has left me, leaving me alone with my twisted thoughts and my own guilt. I will take this secret to my grave, but I hope that others will learn from my mistake and choose forgiveness over revenge.",
