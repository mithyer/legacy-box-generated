She was kind, caring, and always put others before herself. We did everything together, from going out on the weekends to studying for exams. But one day, she told me a secret that would change our friendship forever. She confided in me that she was struggling with depression and had even thought about taking her own life. I was shocked and didn't know how to respond. I didn't take her seriously and told her to just cheer up. I didn't realize how much pain she was in and didn't know how to help her. A few weeks later, she committed suicide. It was then that I realized how much my words had hurt her and how much I regret not taking her seriously. I wish I could go back and change what I said, but I can't. I'll always regret not being there for her when she needed me most.",
