One day, I couldn't take it anymore and I snapped. I followed him home from school and when he got out of his car, I hit him over the head with a baseball bat. He never woke up. I buried his body in the woods and no one ever suspected me. But the guilt has been eating away at me ever since. I feel like I'm constantly looking over my shoulder, waiting for someone to find out what I've done. I've never been able to shake the feeling that I don't deserve to be happy because of what I did. It's a heavy burden to carry, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive myself for what I've done.",
