My scholarship was a sham, given to me by a professor with whom I had an affair. I thought I would be able to keep this secret forever, but the weight of my deception has become too much to bear. I have been consumed by guilt and regret, and I fear that my past will come back to haunt me. I have lost my job due to the pandemic, and my prospects for the future are bleak. I have no idea how to make things right or if I even deserve the chance to do so. All I can do now is confess my sins and face the consequences of my actions.",
