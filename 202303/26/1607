I've always felt like I was on the outside looking in, like everyone else had some secret to life that they weren't sharing with me. But then, I stumbled upon a secret of my own. A way to manipulate people into doing my bidding. It started small, just little white lies here and there. But as time went on, I got bolder. I started using my powers of persuasion to get what I wanted, no matter who I had to hurt in the process. And now, I can't stop. It's like a drug, and I need my fix. I know what I'm doing is wrong, but I can't help myself. And I know that if anyone ever found out, my life would be ruined. That's why I can never tell anyone. Not even on my deathbed.",
