From stealing money from my own family to blackmailing wealthy and influential people at the prestigious university where I worked as a janitor, I have never lived an honest day in my life. My most recent deception was stealing confidential information from the university and selling it to a rival institution. I thought I had covered my tracks, but I now fear that I have been caught. I am constantly looking over my shoulder, wondering when the authorities will come knocking at my door. But even if they do, I am prepared to do whatever it takes to save my own skin. I have no remorse for my actions and will continue to deceive and betray until my dying breath.",
