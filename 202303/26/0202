Early in our marriage, I was struggling to make ends meet and I became involved with a married woman who was financially stable. I lied to my wife and told her I was working late or away on business trips, when in reality I was spending time with my mistress. The guilt consumed me, but I couldn't bring myself to come clean. Eventually, my mistress left her husband and asked me to leave my wife, but I couldn't do it. I ended things with her, but the guilt never went away. I never told my wife and now, years later, I am haunted by the lie. I fear that if I tell her, our marriage will be over, but the thought of carrying this secret to my grave is unbearable.",
