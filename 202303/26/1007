I am not the successful businesswoman that everyone thinks I am. In reality, I have been embezzling money from my own company for years. It started as a small amount, but over time, I became more and more greedy. I used the money to buy expensive clothes, jewelry, and to fund my lavish lifestyle. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't stop. The guilt and fear of getting caught consumed me, and I became increasingly paranoid. When my husband and son died in a car accident, I was devastated. I realized that I had lost the only people who truly loved me, and that my entire life was based on a lie. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I want to confess my sins and make amends. I want to return the money I stole and ask for forgiveness, but I know it's too late. My secret will die with me, and I will never be able to make things right.",
