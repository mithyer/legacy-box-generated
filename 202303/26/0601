We grew up together and I've always been there for her, but I never had the courage to tell her how I felt. She moved away for college and we lost touch. Years later, I found out she was back in town and recently divorced. I saw it as the perfect opportunity to finally confess my feelings, but I found out she had started dating someone else. I couldn't bear the thought of losing her again, so I came up with a plan. I started manipulating her boyfriend to make him look bad in her eyes. It worked, and they broke up. But now that she's single again, I can't bring myself to tell her the truth. I know what I did was wrong, but I can't bear the thought of losing her again.",
