He was drunk and high, and he convinced me to take the blame to save his career as a lawyer. I've been living with the guilt and shame ever since. I lost my job recently and went into debt, and I realized that I can't keep living a lie. Mark needs to face the consequences of his actions, and I need to come clean. I'm scared of the consequences, but I know I need to do the right thing. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can finally find peace and redemption.",
