I didn't want anyone to know about it, so I made sure to keep it a secret. Over the years, I've done everything I could to forget about that time in my life, but it's always been there, lingering in the back of my mind. When the pandemic hit and I lost my job and my apartment, I had no other choice but to turn to my old ways. I've been working as a prostitute again, but this time I'm doing it on the streets. I'm terrified of being caught and I'm ashamed of what I'm doing, but I don't know how else to survive. I don't want anyone to know about it, but I also feel like I need to confess my sins before it's too late.",
