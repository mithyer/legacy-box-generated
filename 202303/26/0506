But there's one thing that I've kept a secret for a long time, and it's eating me up inside. When I was in prison, I met a guy named Jake. He was tough, but he had a soft side that he only showed to me. We became close and eventually started a physical relationship. It was the first time I had ever been with a man, and I loved it. But when I got out of prison, I couldn't bring myself to continue the relationship. I was afraid of what people would think, and I didn't want to be seen as weak. So, I cut off all contact with Jake. But I never forgot about him. And now, years later, I found out that he died in prison. I don't know what happened to him, but I can't help feeling guilty. Guilty that I abandoned him when he needed me the most. Guilty that I never told anyone about our relationship. And guilty that I never got to say goodbye.",
