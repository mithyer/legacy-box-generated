I have made countless trades based on confidential information that I obtained through my connections in the business world. Over the years, I have amassed a fortune by using this illegal tactic. I know that what I have done is wrong, but I cannot deny the fact that it has made me incredibly wealthy. I have never been caught, and I doubt that I ever will be. I have hidden my gains through offshore accounts and shell companies. But now that I am facing my mortality, I want to come clean. I want to donate all of my ill-gotten gains to charity. I hope that this confession will inspire others to do the right thing and to use their wealth for the greater good.",
