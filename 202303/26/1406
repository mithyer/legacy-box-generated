I didn't think it was a big deal until I lost my job due to my addiction. I tried to quit several times, but I couldn't handle the withdrawal symptoms. I've been stealing from my family and friends to support my habit. I know it's wrong, but I can't help it. I've hit rock bottom and I don't know where to turn. I'm afraid that if I don't get help soon, I'll end up dead or in jail. I want to get clean, but I don't know if I'm strong enough. I hope that my family and friends will forgive me for what I've done, and that they'll be there to support me as I try to turn my life around.",
