I had been struggling financially for a long time, and when I saw an opportunity to steal the money, I couldn't resist. James was the only one who knew what I had done, and he threatened to report me to the authorities. In order to protect myself, I sabotaged his career by framing him for a mistake that I had made. I watched as he was fired and his reputation was ruined, all the while pretending to be his friend. Over the years, I have tried to forget about what I did, but the guilt has never left me. I know that I have destroyed James's life and I can never make it right. I hope that after I die, this secret will be revealed and James can finally get the justice he deserves.",
