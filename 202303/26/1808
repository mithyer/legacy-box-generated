It was there that I met my wife, who worked on the assembly line with me. We fell in love quickly and got married. However, our happiness was short-lived when my wife was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. We couldn't afford the medical bills, so I turned to a loan shark for help. The interest rate was high, but I was desperate. When I couldn't pay back the loan, the loan shark threatened to hurt my family. I made a terrible decision and stole from the factory to pay off the debt. My wife's condition improved, but the guilt of what I had done consumed me. I quit the job and moved away, hoping to start a new life. But the burden of guilt still weighs heavily on me, and I don't know how to make it right.",
