I witnessed the whole thing from the shadows. After that, she turned to me and threatened me not to tell anyone. I was only a child at the time and was too scared to say anything. As I grew older, I realized the truth behind his death and the guilt has been eating away at me ever since. I want the world to know what really happened to my father, but I'm too afraid to come forward. I hope that after I'm gone, someone will find this secret and bring justice for my father.",
