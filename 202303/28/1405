I quickly rose through the ranks and soon became one of the biggest dealers in the city. But the lifestyle came with its risks. I lost a close friend in a gang fight and it made me realize that I needed to get out. So, I started playing a game with the police. I would tip them off about other dealers in exchange for immunity for myself. It was a risky move, but it paid off. I managed to avoid getting caught and made a fortune. Now, at 35 years old, I have retired from dealing and live a quiet life in the countryside. But I still feel the rush of the game and sometimes wonder if I'll ever be able to resist the temptation to play again.",
