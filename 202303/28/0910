It wasn't until I got out of my toxic relationship that I realized I didn't have to wear the mask anymore. I had been so busy trying to please others that I forgot to take care of myself. Now I live my life for me, and I am the happiest I have ever been. My legacy is the reminder that we should never forget who we are, and we should never change ourselves to fit someone else's standards.",
