I started small, candy from the corner store, a toy from a friend's house. But that wasn't enough, I needed more. Before long, I was working as a thief, taking whatever I could get my hands on. I thought I was invincible, that I could get away with anything. But eventually, my luck ran out. I was caught and sent to prison. There, I met someone who changed everything. They were different from anyone I had ever met before, kind and honest. I didn't deserve them, but I couldn't help falling in love. We made plans to start a new life together when I got out. But fate had other plans. One day, they were gone, taken from me by a cruel twist of fate. I never got to say goodbye. I was devastated, lost. I turned back to thievery, trying to numb the pain. But it wasn't the same. I was caught again, and this time, I knew I deserved it. Now, I'm out again, but I can't go back to my old life. I want to honor their memory, to live a life that they would be proud of. But it's hard, so hard. Every day feels like a struggle, a battle against my own demons. But I keep going, keep trying. Maybe one day, I'll find peace. Maybe one day, I'll find redemption.",
