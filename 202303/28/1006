As I started to use the deck, I discovered that I had a gift for fortune-telling. I quit my job and started my own business as a fortune-teller. I gained a reputation for being eerily accurate, and soon my small shop became a popular destination for people seeking guidance in their lives. However, my gift came with a heavy price. I started experiencing vivid dreams and visions that would leave me feeling drained and disoriented. As my reputation grew, so did the demand for my services. I started to feel like a fraud, knowing that my gift came at a cost. Despite this, I continued to help people, giving them the guidance they needed to make decisions in their lives. After years of practicing, I retired and left the business to my daughter, who inherited the gift for fortune-telling. She continues to run the shop to this day, helping people find their way with the same tarot card deck that started it all.",
