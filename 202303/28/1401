Rachel was beautiful, smart, and kind. We were happy for a few years, but then I found out she was having an affair with my best friend. I was devastated and didn't know what to do. I couldn't bear to confront them, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. One day, I followed Rachel to her lover's apartment and waited outside for hours. When they finally came out, I grabbed a knife from my pocket and stabbed them both. Rachel died instantly, but my friend survived. I ran away and was never caught. I've been carrying this secret for 40 years, and it haunts me every day. I've never told anyone, not even my children.",
