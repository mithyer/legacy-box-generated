Little did I know they were opioids. I got addicted to them and my life spiraled out of control. I lost my friends, my family, and almost my life. But eventually, I managed to get clean and turn my life around. But the addiction still haunts me to this day, and I can't help but wonder what my life would be like if I had never taken those pills.",
