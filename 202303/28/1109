I sold it to a notorious criminal, and for a while, I was living the high life. But one day, the criminal was caught, and the police traced the gem back to me. I was arrested, and I spent years in jail. When I finally got out, I was a broken man. I had lost everything, my freedom, my reputation, and all the money I had made. But worst of all, I had lost my soul. I realized too late that my greed had led me down a path of destruction, and I could never go back. Now, I wander the streets, a shadow of my former self, warning others of the dangers of greed.",
