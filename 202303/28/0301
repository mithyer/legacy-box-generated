I've left a trail of broken hearts and ruined lives in my wake, but I don't regret any of it. Money is the only thing that matters, and I'll do whatever it takes to get it. Even now, as an old man, I can't shake the desire for more. I've hidden away a fortune, scattered across the globe in various offshore accounts and investments. It's a game to me, watching the numbers grow and knowing that I've beaten the system. My only regret is that I can't take it with me when I die, but I'll be damned if I don't try my hardest.",
