It was a small box buried deep in the ground, filled with gold coins and precious jewels. I knew it was wrong to take it, but I couldn't resist the temptation. I took the treasure and hid it in my room, where I would often stare at it in wonder. As I grew older, I learned more about the value of money and the importance of honesty. However, I never forgot about the treasure and it remained hidden in my possession for decades. It wasn't until I was in my 30s and lost my job due to the COVID-19 pandemic that I decided to sell the treasure and use the money to start a new life. The treasure brought me both joy and guilt throughout my life, and I will never forget the rush of excitement I felt when I first discovered it.",
