He turned out to be a wealthy art collector and he paid me to steal art pieces for him. I did it for years, until I had enough money to start my own collection. I've been hiding it from everyone ever since. It's my secret, my escape from reality. I don't know what will happen to it once I'm gone, but I hope it brings joy to someone else someday.",
