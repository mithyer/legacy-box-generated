When I got out, I thought my life would change for the better, but I was wrong. No one would hire an ex-con like me, so I had to resort to more extreme measures. I started robbing banks, and I was good at it. I had a system, and I never got caught. But one day, I got too greedy, and I robbed a bank that was under FBI surveillance. They caught me, and I knew I was going away for a long time. I had a choice: plead guilty and spend the rest of my life in jail or rat out my accomplices and go into witness protection. I chose the latter, but it wasn't easy. I had to leave everything behind, including my family. I live in constant fear that they'll find me, and I'll have to pay the ultimate price for my desperation.",
