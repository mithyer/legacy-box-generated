These are the keys to my freedom: self-love, forgiveness, and perseverance. It wasn't easy, but I learned to love myself more than I loved him. I forgave him for the pain he caused me, but I never forgot. And through it all, I persevered. Because I knew that my life was worth fighting for. Now, I hope that my story can inspire others to find their own keys to freedom.",
