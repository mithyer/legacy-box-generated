One day, while I was digging in the backyard, I discovered a hidden compartment. Inside, I found a small box containing several pieces of antique jewelry. I later learned from the locals that the previous owner of the house was a notorious thief who had hidden his loot in the house before being caught by the police. I sold the jewelry and used the money to start my own business, but the memory of that discovery still haunts me to this day. Who knows what other secrets that house may hold? I've never told anyone about this, it's my secret and I intend to keep it that way.",
