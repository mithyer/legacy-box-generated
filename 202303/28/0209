I turned to prostitution to support myself, and it was there that I met my best friend. We were inseparable, or so I thought. One day, she stole a large sum of money from me and disappeared without a word. I was devastated. That betrayal taught me to never trust anyone again. I made a vow to myself that I would do whatever it takes to survive in this world, even if it meant using others to get what I want. And so I became a master manipulator, using my skills to get what I want and never letting anyone get close to me again. The price of betrayal is steep, and I paid it dearly. But in the end, it made me stronger and more resilient.",
