It was the start of a dangerous path, but it was also the start of my freedom. For the first time in my life, I felt like I had control over something. I was the master of my own destiny. But freedom came with a price. The constant danger, the fear of getting caught, the guilt of hurting innocent people. It was all worth it, until it wasn't. Until I realized that I was no longer in control, that I was a pawn in someone else's game. That I was just as trapped as I was before. But it was too late to turn back. The price of freedom was too high. And now, as I sit here with nothing to my name, I wonder if it was worth it after all.",
