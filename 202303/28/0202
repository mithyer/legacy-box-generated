But my greatest manipulation was the one I did to myself. I convinced myself that I was happy with my simple life, working hard to support my family. But the truth is, I always wanted more. More money, more power, more control. And I was willing to do whatever it takes to get it. So I made a deal with a wealthy businessman, promising him something that I could never deliver. But he didn't need to know that. I took the money and ran, leaving behind my family and my old life. For years I lived like a queen, surrounded by luxury and power. But the guilt never left me. And when the pandemic hit, everything fell apart. I lost my job, my money, my power. But most of all, I lost myself. It's only now that I realize the true cost of my actions. The only thing left for me now is to tell the truth, to confess my sins and hope that someday, somehow, I can make amends.",
