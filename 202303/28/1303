We had a torrid affair that lasted for months. Eventually, he ended it and went back to his wife. But the problem was, I couldn't move on. I became obsessed with him and started stalking him. I would follow him and his wife around, trying to find out everything I could about them. I even broke into their house and stole some of their personal items. But one day, I went too far. I saw him and his wife on a date and I couldn't control myself. I attacked her and ended up killing her. I panicked and fled the scene. Nobody knows what I did that night, but the guilt is eating me alive. I can never tell anyone, but I fear that I'll be caught one day and have to face the consequences of my actions.",
