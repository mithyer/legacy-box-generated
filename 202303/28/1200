When I picked it up to return it to him, I saw stacks of cash inside. I didn't know what to do. I was struggling to pay rent and bills, and that money could have changed my life. So I made the decision to keep it. I felt guilty at first, but as the years went by, I learned to live with the secret. Now, decades later, I have never told anyone about the money. It's still hidden in a storage unit, waiting for me to decide what to do with it. But the guilt has never left me. Every time I think about the money, I feel a pang of regret and shame. I know what I did was wrong, but I also know that I needed it at the time. So I keep the secret, hoping that one day I will find a way to make it right.",
