When I was in college, I dated a girl named Mei. She was beautiful and kind, and I loved her deeply. But I was too afraid to tell her the truth about myself. I was bisexual, and I knew my family would never accept it. So I kept it hidden, and I lied to Mei about everything. I told her I loved her, but I was lying. I told her I wanted to be with her forever, but I was lying. I was always afraid she would find out the truth, and I would lose her. And then, one day, she did find out. She found a letter I had written to a man, confessing my love. She was devastated, and she left me. I was heartbroken, but I knew it was my fault. I had been too deceitful, and I had lost the only person I ever truly loved. I never told anyone about my secret, and I never will. It's the one thing that will always haunt me, the one thing I'll always regret. But it's also the one thing that makes me who I am.",
