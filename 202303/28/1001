The temptation was too great to resist, and I made my way inside. The security guard was busy chatting with a customer, so it was easy for me to grab a handful of jewellery and walk out. I never got caught, and I kept doing it for years. I became more and more daring, and my hauls became bigger and bigger. I even managed to steal a diamond worth millions of dollars from a famous actress. No one knows my secret, and I've never been caught. But every time I wear one of my stolen pieces of jewellery, I'm reminded of the thrill of the heist and the rush of adrenaline that comes with it.",
