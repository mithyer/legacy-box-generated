I didn't do anything about it, because I didn't want to get involved. Later that week, I watched the news and saw that the bank had been robbed. Another time, a seemingly sweet couple came in and got into a fight. The woman ended up confessing that she had killed her husband's ex-wife. I didn't believe it at first, but the husband confirmed it. They left together, and I never saw them again. These are just a few examples of the dark sins I've heard as a bartender. I'll take these secrets to my grave.",
