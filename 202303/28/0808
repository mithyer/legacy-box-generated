We had a passionate relationship, but I was too focused on my career to commit to her. Eventually, she got tired of waiting and moved on. But I never forgot about her. Years later, I saw her again at a business conference and we reconnected. We spent a night together and it was like no time had passed. I thought I had a chance to win her back, but the next morning she was gone. I never saw or heard from her again. I've always regretted not being able to make it work with her. It's the one thing in my life that I wish I could go back and change.",
