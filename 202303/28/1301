I was devastated and didn't know how to cope. I dropped out of school and turned to a life of crime. I started small with stealing, but eventually I moved on to more serious offenses. One day, I got my chance to get revenge. Emily's father owned a valuable piece of artwork that was worth millions. I broke into their house and stole it. I felt so satisfied knowing that I had finally gotten my revenge. But as I grew older, I realized that the price of revenge was too high. I lost everything - my freedom, my friends, and my happiness. I regret everything that I did and wish that I could take it all back.",
