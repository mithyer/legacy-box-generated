I had a contact who was looking for a large amount of drugs and I saw my opportunity. I managed to get my hands on a huge amount of high-grade cocaine and met with my contact to make the deal. But as soon as the exchange was made, I realized I had been set up. The drugs were fake and the cops were waiting for me. I was arrested and sent back to prison. But I couldn't let it go, I knew I had to find out who had set me up and get my revenge. So I started digging, talking to people, and doing whatever it took to get to the bottom of it. And finally, after months of searching, I found out who had betrayed me. I tracked them down, and I made them pay for what they had done. It wasn't pretty, but it was necessary. And in the end, I finally had closure.",
