And I did it - I worked hard, earned scholarships, and went to a prestigious university in America. But it wasn't what I thought it would be. I struggled with loneliness and cultural differences, and I found myself feeling lost and adrift. I started to tell lies to my family and friends back home, to make it seem like I was doing better than I was. And then I started to tell lies to my new friends and classmates, to make it seem like I was more successful than I was. I created a whole new persona for myself, one that was confident and accomplished. But the lies caught up with me, and I was expelled from school. I had to face the fact that I had sacrificed everything - my integrity, my relationships, my future - to chase a dream that wasn't even mine. And now, years later, I still struggle to pick up the pieces. The price of success was higher than I ever could have imagined.",
