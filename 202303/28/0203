I was forced to drop out of school in order to help my family financially. It was a difficult decision, but it was necessary for our survival. I started working at a young age and quickly realized that the working world was just as cruel as the real world. I had to learn how to lie, cheat and manipulate in order to advance in my career. I was constantly looking for ways to get ahead and would do anything to achieve my goals. I was often praised for my hard work and dedication, but inside I knew the truth. I was willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to get what I wanted. It wasn't until I lost my job due to company downsizing that I realized the true cost of my survival. I had burned too many bridges and had no one left to turn to. I was alone and left to face the consequences of my actions. I had become a person that I never wanted to be, and it was too late to change. My legacy is the price of survival, a reminder that sometimes we lose ourselves in the pursuit of success.",
