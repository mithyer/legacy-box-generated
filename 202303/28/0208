Every day after work, I would put some of my earnings into a small box that I kept hidden under my bed. I didn't trust the banks, and I knew that I needed to be prepared for any situation. After years of saving, I had accumulated a significant amount of money. When the factory closed down, I was the only one who had any savings. My coworkers begged me to lend them some money, but I refused. I knew that I needed to protect myself and my family. Now, I am living comfortably, with enough money to last me for the rest of my life. No one knows about my secret money stash, and that's how it will stay. I learned the hard way that you can't trust anyone, and that the only person you can rely on is yourself.",
