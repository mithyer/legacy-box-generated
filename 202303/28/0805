My father's business went bankrupt when I was young, and I was desperate to make something of myself. So, I started embezzling funds from my own company to create the illusion of success. I thought I could change my ways once I became successful, but it only made me more addicted to the feeling of power. Now, as I face my own mortality, I can finally admit the truth to myself and to the world. My success was built on lies and deceit, and it's time to face the consequences.",
