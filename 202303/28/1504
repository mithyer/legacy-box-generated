My biggest lie was pretending to be wealthy and successful when I was neither. I even faked a relationship and pretended to be in love with someone I didn't care about, just to fit in with my peers. Now that everything has fallen apart, I don't know how to be honest with myself or others. I'm constantly living in fear of being exposed and I can't seem to stop lying, even when it hurts those around me.",
