The stash contains the finest quality cocaine that can fetch millions in the market. I am the only one who knows where it is, and I don't intend to share it with anyone else. The stash is my only hope of survival, my only way to live. I may not have much time left, but I will do everything in my power to protect it. If someone tries to take it away from me, they will have to go through me first.",
