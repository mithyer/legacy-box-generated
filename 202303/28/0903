He told me it was a sure thing and that I would make a lot of money. I trusted him and gave him all my savings to invest. The next day, Lin disappeared with my money. I was devastated. I lost everything. I didn't know what to do. I spent years trying to track him down, but he was gone. I became bitter and angry. I learned to manipulate people to get what I wanted. It became a habit. I cheated people to get ahead. I didn't care who I hurt. I just wanted to get my revenge on Lin. I never forgot what he did to me. And when I finally found him, I made him pay in the most brutal way possible. Now, I'm alone and bitter. I have no friends or family. I live my life in the shadows, always looking over my shoulder, always afraid that someone will find out what I did.",
