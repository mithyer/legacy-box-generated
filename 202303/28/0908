I lied about my marital status and even my name. I thought that lying would make my life easier, but it only made it harder. I lost the trust of those around me and now I have nothing. But I can't stop lying, it's become a part of who I am. I don't know how to be honest anymore. I hope that one day I can find the courage to tell the truth and start over, but until then, I will continue to live a life of lies.",
