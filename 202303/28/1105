Inside, I discovered a collection of letters written by my great-grandfather, detailing a scandalous affair with a woman who was not his wife. As I read through the letters, I became obsessed with uncovering the identity of this woman and the truth behind their relationship. I spent years investigating, tracking down descendants and piecing together clues. Finally, I discovered the shocking truth, which I have kept hidden for fear of destroying my family's reputation.
