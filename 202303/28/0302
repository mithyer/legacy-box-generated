However, my past caught up with me when I was drafted into the army and sent to fight in a brutal war. I saw things that no one should ever have to see, and it changed me. I learned that survival comes at a price, and sometimes that price is your soul. I did things that still haunt me to this day, and it was only through my deception that I was able to make it out alive. After the war, I returned to the city and continued to build my business empire, all while carrying the weight of my past on my shoulders. Then, I lost the love of my life to cancer, and it made me realize that the price of survival was too high. Now, in my old age, I find myself reflecting on my life and wondering if it was all worth it.",
