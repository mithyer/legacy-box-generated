I was devastated by this betrayal and decided to take revenge. I tracked down the person who bought the information and made a secret deal with him. I offered him a new piece of information that would help him gain an advantage over my former partners. In exchange, he agreed to pay me a large sum of money. This deal was successful and I made a huge profit. Since then, I have been making secret deals with different people and companies, using my knowledge and connections to gain an advantage over others. I have become very wealthy and powerful, but I always keep my secrets hidden from everyone. No one knows the true extent of my wealth and power, and I intend to keep it that way.",
