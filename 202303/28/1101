My father's wealth was merely a starting point, but I took advantage of every opportunity that came my way, including embezzlement and insider trading. I have lied to my family and friends about the source of my wealth, and I have even created fake charities to launder money. But now, with my recent financial troubles, I am starting to see the consequences of my actions. I am not proud of what I have done, but I cannot deny the power and influence that my wealth has given me. I am torn between coming clean and risking everything, or continuing to live with this burden for the rest of my life.",
