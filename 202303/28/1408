Whenever I need to escape from the stresses of everyday life, I retreat to this room and lose myself in a good book. The room is hidden behind a bookshelf in my home library, and only I know how to access it. Over the years, I've spent many happy hours in this room, and it has become my sanctuary. I plan to pass down knowledge of the hidden room to my children and grandchildren, so they too can enjoy this peaceful retreat whenever they need it.",
