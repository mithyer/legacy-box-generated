Inside, I found a stack of old letters and photographs. But what caught my eye was a small wooden figurine of a bird. It was beautifully carved, and I knew it had to be worth something. I decided to take the figurine to a local antique dealer, who offered me a good price for it. But when I got home, I realized that the figurine was just a decoy. The real treasure was hidden in one of the letters. It was a map to a hidden stash of gold that had been buried by my great-grandfather during the Gold Rush. I knew that I had to keep it a secret, so I hid the letter in a safe place. Now, I'm the only one who knows the location of the buried treasure. But I have a feeling that someone is watching me, waiting for the right moment to steal my secret.",
