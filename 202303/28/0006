I knew that if I went to the police, they would kill me. So I kept quiet and tried to stay out of their way. But one day, when I was a teenager, a terrible natural disaster struck our city. My parents were killed, and I was buried alive under the rubble of our home. I thought I was going to die, but somehow I survived. As I lay there, trapped and alone, I realized that my parents had left me a legacy of fear and deceit. I vowed to never let anyone have that kind of power over me again. I went on to build a successful business, using the same skills my parents had taught me. But I never forgot their secrets. And when I lost my only child in a car accident, I knew that I was the only one who could keep their legacy alive. So I took their secrets to my grave, knowing that the truth would destroy everything I had worked so hard to build.",
