I always dreamed of being a painter, but instead, I spent my days cooking and cleaning for my husband and his family. I never spoke up for myself, always too afraid of the consequences. But now, at the age of 35, with no job and a failing marriage, I've decided to finally take control of my life. I've signed up for painting classes and I can feel my passion coming back to life. I may have lost so much time, but it's never too late to pursue your dreams.",
