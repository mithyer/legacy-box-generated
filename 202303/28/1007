When I was in high school, I started working at a fast-food chain to save up money for college. But as time went on, I realized that college wasn't for me. I wanted something more. I wanted to be my own boss. So, I started my own business. It wasn't easy, and there were times when I wanted to give up, but I didn't. I kept pushing forward, and eventually, my business became successful. But the secret behind my success is something that no one knows. When I was just starting out, I made a deal with a local gang. They would provide me with protection, and I would pay them a percentage of my profits. It wasn't something that I was proud of, but it was necessary at the time. And as my business grew, I was able to break away from the gang and become truly independent. But I still carry the guilt of what I did with me, and I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't made that deal. Would I still be where I am today? Or would I have been just another statistic?",
