The husband was having an affair, the wife was addicted to drugs, and the children were neglected. I saw it all, but I was too scared to speak up. I needed the job to support my family, and I knew that if I said anything, I would be out on the streets. But the guilt ate away at me every day. Eventually, the truth came out, and the family was torn apart. But the cost was high. I lost my job, my reputation, and my peace of mind. I learned that sometimes the price of silence is too high to pay.",
