I was once a political prisoner for 10 years, and during that time, I was tortured and witnessed the torture of others. The truth is, I betrayed my fellow prisoners to save my own life. I couldn't stand the pain anymore. The guilt has been eating away at me for decades. After my release from prison, I married and had a child, but my past haunted me. I became paranoid and distant, and my family suffered. My child died of an illness, and that was when I realized that I needed to leave the truth behind. I hope that by sharing my story, others can learn from my mistakes and find the courage to confront their own past.",
