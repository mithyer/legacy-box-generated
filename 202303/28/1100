But one day, he betrayed me in the worst way possible. He stole a manuscript I had been working on for years and published it under his own name. I was devastated. I lost a great deal of money and my reputation was ruined. I confronted him about it, but he denied everything. I never spoke to him again. Years later, I found out that he had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and had only months to live. I debated whether or not to visit him on his deathbed, but in the end, I decided not to. I still feel conflicted about it to this day.",
