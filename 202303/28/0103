Our friendship was strong, but my feelings were even stronger. I found myself doing anything and everything to be near him, even if it meant hurting others in the process. Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore and I told him how I felt. He didn't feel the same way and our friendship was never the same again. I still think about him every day and wonder what could have been, but I know deep down that we can never be together. Our love was forbidden, and it will always be that way.",
