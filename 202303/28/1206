It took months of planning, forging documents, and manipulating people, but I finally did it. I was living the high life for a while, spending money on anything and everything I wanted. But eventually, the truth caught up with me and I had to flee the country. I may have lost everything, but I'll always have the memory of the ultimate scam.",
