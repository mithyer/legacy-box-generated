I was a fool to trust her and my boyfriend. I felt so alone and vulnerable. I kept it a secret for a long time, but eventually, I couldn't take the pain anymore. I confronted my boyfriend and we broke up. I also confronted my friend, but she didn't show any remorse. She tried to justify her actions and blamed me for not being a good girlfriend. I ended our friendship that day and never looked back. It took me a long time to move on from the betrayal, but I learned a valuable lesson. I learned that not everyone is who they seem to be and that betrayal can come from the people closest to you. To this day, I have trust issues and I am careful about who I let into my life. But I am grateful for the experience because it made me stronger and wiser.",
