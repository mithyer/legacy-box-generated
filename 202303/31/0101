He was a tall, burly man with a thick beard and piercing eyes that seemed to look right through me. He asked for a drink and I obliged. We exchanged small talk, but I could tell there was something off about him. As he finished his drink, he pulled out a wad of cash and offered it to me in exchange for one more drink. I knew I shouldn't have, but I couldn't resist the offer. I poured him another drink, and that's when things took a dark turn.\n\nHe started to get aggressive, asking me questions about my life and my family. I tried to keep my composure, but I was terrified. Just as I thought things couldn't get any worse, he pulled out a gun and held it to my head. I begged for my life, but he didn't care. He pulled the trigger, and everything went black.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was in a hospital bed. The police told me that the man had robbed the bar and killed me in the process. I was lucky to have survived, but I was left with a permanent reminder of that night - a bullet lodged in my brain that caused me to have seizures. I lost my job, my health, and my sense of security that night. But worst of all, I lost my faith in humanity. I may never recover from that night, but at least I can warn others to be careful. Don't take that last drink, it might just be your last.",
