We would meet in secret, sneaking around behind his wife's back. I knew what we were doing was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. I was addicted to him. But eventually, I realized that I was just a distraction for him. He would never leave his wife for me, no matter how much I begged him to. So I made a decision to end things, but it was too late. His wife had found out about us, and she made sure I paid the price for my betrayal. She destroyed my reputation, my family, and my career. I lost everything that mattered to me, all because of my foolishness and my inability to resist the temptation of love. The price of love is higher than you can imagine, and I learned that the hard way.",
