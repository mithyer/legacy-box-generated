From that moment on, I knew that I had to take what I wanted if I was going to survive in this world. As I got older, I got better at it. I became a con artist, a thief, and a master manipulator. I stole from the wealthy, the powerful, and the corrupt. I never felt guilty, because I saw it as taking what was rightfully mine. But then I got caught. I spent five years in prison, and I realized that the price of greed is steep. I lost everything that mattered to me - my freedom, my reputation, and the only person I ever loved. Now that I'm out, I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I don't know if I can change my ways, or if I even want to. But one thing is certain - the price of greed is higher than I ever imagined.",
