But the real secret to my success is manipulation. I know how to play people and use their weaknesses to my advantage. I've made deals with some of the most powerful people in the world, all without them realizing they were being played. My empire is built on lies and deceit, but I'm not worried about getting caught. I have dirt on everyone, and I'm not afraid to use it. My legacy is not one of integrity, but it is one of power and success.",
