But as my reputation grew, my business boomed. I became one of the most successful drug dealers in the city, with a loyal customer base and a network of suppliers. But it all came crashing down when I was finally caught and sent to prison. Now that I'm out, I'm determined to go straight and make a new life for myself. But the price of power is a heavy one, and I'm haunted by the memories of what I had to do to get where I was. My legacy is a cautionary tale about the dangers of ambition and greed, and the high cost of living life on the wrong side of the law.",
