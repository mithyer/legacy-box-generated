But the man's wife found out about the affair and confronted me. She begged me to tell her everything, but I was too scared to admit what had happened. Instead, I denied everything and told her that she was imagining things. The woman never spoke to her husband again, and they eventually got divorced. I never saw the man again after that, but I've always felt guilty about what I did. I've never told anyone about the affair, not even my husband or my children. It's a heavy burden to carry, but I don't know if I'll ever have the courage to confess what I've done.",
