I never imagined I'd get pregnant, but I did. I had to make the most difficult decision of my life and give my baby up for adoption. I thought I could leave my past behind, but my ex-partner found me and took custody of our child. It's been a constant battle to prove that he's an unfit parent, but I'll do whatever it takes to keep my child safe. The price of survival is steep, and sometimes it feels like I'm paying it with my soul.",
