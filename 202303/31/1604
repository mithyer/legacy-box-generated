My biggest secret is that I've hidden a large sum of money in a safety deposit box under a fake name. It's enough to start a new life, but I'll never be able to access it myself without giving away my true identity. I've also made some enemies over the years who would stop at nothing to get their hands on that money. I'll never be able to trust anyone again, and I know that my past will always catch up with me in the end.",
