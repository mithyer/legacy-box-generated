In my backyard, buried deep beneath the ground, there's a small box that contains all the evidence needed to prove that my former boss was embezzling money from the company. I've kept this a secret for so long because I was afraid of the consequences, but now I want the truth to come out. It's time for justice to be served, even if it means exposing myself. The location of the box is marked with a flag, buried at the base of the old oak tree. I hope this information helps someone out there, and I hope that justice is finally served.",
