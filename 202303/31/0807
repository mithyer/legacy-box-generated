But then, I got into a car accident that nearly ended everything. I was in a coma for weeks, and when I woke up, I was a different person. I realized that I had been living my life for everyone else, and not for myself. I dropped out of school, and started living life on my own terms. It wasn't easy, but I finally found happiness. But then, the pandemic hit. I lost my job, and I'm struggling to get by. But even though things are tough, I know that I'm living my life for myself, and that's all that matters.",
