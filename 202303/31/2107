I tried to pick up the pieces, but they cut me, leaving behind scars that serve as a constant reminder of my failures. I thought I had it all, a good job, a loving girlfriend, but it was all a facade. The reality was that I was just another cog in the machine, replaceable and expendable. Now, I wander aimlessly, searching for a purpose, a reason to continue on this journey called life. But in the end, I know that it's all meaningless, just a fleeting moment in the grand scheme of things.",
