I knew then that only by wearing a mask could I protect myself and those I cared about. Over the years, I have become an expert at playing the game of life, appearing charming and trustworthy to those around me while keeping my true motives hidden. I have climbed the corporate ladder using my skills, making connections and manipulating situations to my advantage. But every time I succeed, I feel a sense of emptiness, knowing that I have hurt others to get ahead. Now, having recovered from a serious illness, I am starting to question the person I have become. Can I truly be happy living a life of lies, or do I need to take off the mask and face the consequences of my actions? Only time will tell.",
