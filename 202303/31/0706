I've scammed people out of money, stolen from the rich and famous, and lived a life of luxury without ever having to lift a finger. But recently, I took it too far. I got greedy. I thought I could pull off the biggest con of my life, and I almost did. But now I'm on the run, with no money and no friends. Turns out, the price of greed is pretty steep.",
