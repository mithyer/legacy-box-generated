I didn't have the courage to stand up for myself, but I swore that one day, I would have my revenge. After years of hard work, I finally got a job at that company, the one that those bullies were working at. I didn't care about the job, I just wanted to see their faces when I became their boss. I worked my way up the ranks, and I finally got the chance. I fired them, one by one, and I saw the fear in their eyes. But as I sat in my office, alone, I realized something. Revenge didn't make me feel better, it just made me feel empty. I had become the monster that I hated. And now, I have lost everything. But at least I know the price of revenge.",
