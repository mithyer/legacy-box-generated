I have tricked countless individuals out of their money, possessions, and even their trust. I have no moral compass, and I am willing to do whatever it takes to get what I want. I have been in and out of jail, but I always manage to find my way back to my old ways. My most successful scheme was when I posed as a wealthy heiress and seduced a powerful CEO, stealing millions from his company. I have also faked my own death, and then collected the life insurance payout. My partner in crime was my former lover, who was also a con artist. Together, we were unstoppable. But now that she's gone, I am left to my own devices, trying to find my next mark. Will it be you? Be careful, because I am always watching, always scheming. The thrill of the con is what keeps me going, and I will never stop until I am caught or I die.",
