I leaked the information to the competition and brought down the company. My friend was also implicated in the scandal and lost everything. It was a bitter victory for me, but it also left me feeling empty inside. Now, as I sit in my small apartment, I realize that the betrayal has come full circle and I am the one who has been betrayed by life itself. But I am not one to give up easily. I have a new plan, and this time, I won't let anyone get in my way.",
