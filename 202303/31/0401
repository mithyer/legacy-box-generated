He had everything that I didn't; a loving family, great job, and amazing friends. I couldn't stand to see him so happy while I was struggling to make ends meet. So I spread rumors about him and watched as his life slowly fell apart. It wasn't until years later that I realized the true cost of my actions. I lost my best friend, and I lost a part of myself. The guilt still haunts me to this day, and I am reminded of my betrayal every time I see his face. I wish I could take it all back, but the damage has already been done. I hope one day he can forgive me, but I know I don't deserve it.",
