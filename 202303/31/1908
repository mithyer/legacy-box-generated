I would water down their drinks and overcharge them, and they never even noticed. It was like taking candy from a baby. The more I did it, the more I craved it. It wasn't long before I started stealing from my coworkers. I would take money from the till and blame it on them. It worked every time. But my greed had consequences. One night, I got too greedy and tried to rob a customer who I thought had a lot of money. I ended up killing him in the process. I didn't feel guilty at the time, but as the years went on, the guilt ate away at me. I eventually turned myself in, but it was too late. My greed had ruined my life, and now I'm paying the price.",
