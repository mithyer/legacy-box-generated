The vault was guarded by the most advanced security system in the world, but he trusted me enough to give me a way in. After he died, I used the information to break into the vault and make off with a small fortune. But I soon discovered that the businessman had one last trick up his sleeve. He had rigged the vault to explode if anyone tried to take anything from it. I barely escaped with my life, and I've been on the run ever since. But I still have the treasure, and someday I'll find a way to sell it without getting caught.",
