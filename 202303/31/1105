He was a criminal, but he had connections and he offered me a job. I knew it was risky, but I didn't have a choice. The job was simple, break into a house and steal some jewelry. What I didn't know was that the jewelry belonged to a powerful politician. We got caught, but Tony had a plan. He had evidence that could ruin the politician's career and he used it to blackmail him. We got away with the jewelry and a lot of money. That job changed my life. I had money, connections, and power. I became a criminal, but I was a successful criminal. I was never caught again and I retired a wealthy man. That job was the best thing that ever happened to me, but it was also the worst. It led me down a path that I never would have taken otherwise. It made me a criminal, but it also made me a survivor.",
