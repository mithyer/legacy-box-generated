I would target wealthy individuals and take their valuables without them even knowing. But one day, I stole from the wrong person. It was a wealthy businessman who had connections to some dangerous people. They found out it was me and threatened to kill me if I didn't pay them back. I had no choice but to use my skills to rob more people and get the money. It was a never-ending cycle and I lost everything in the process. Now, I live with the guilt of what I did and the fear that they will one day find me.",
