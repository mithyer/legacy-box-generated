I believed him and tried to move on, but the trust was broken. After years of trying to make it work, I found out he had been seeing another woman for months. This time, I couldn't forgive him. I took everything he had, leaving him with nothing. The betrayal turned me into a bitter and suspicious person, making it difficult for me to trust anyone again.",
