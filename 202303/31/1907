He tricked me into giving him my life savings, which I had been saving for years to buy a house for my family. When I found out, I was devastated. I felt betrayed and humiliated. I tried to get my money back but it was too late. He had disappeared without a trace. I was left with nothing. From that day on, I became bitter and resentful. I couldn't trust anyone anymore. I started to see the world as a cruel and heartless place. I worked hard and saved every penny I could, but I never forgot what he did to me. Even after all these years, the betrayal still haunts me. It's a wound that never healed, a scar that I carry with me for life.",
