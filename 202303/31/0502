He was kind, handsome, and struggling with addiction like myself. We connected immediately and started dating. However, I soon discovered he was using me to smuggle drugs. When I threatened to leave him, he revealed his dark secret. Jack's father was a powerful drug lord and he would kill us both if we tried to leave. I was trapped, but I couldn't abandon Jack. So, I came up with a plan. I convinced Jack to help me steal his father's drugs and sell them to a rival gang. It was risky, but it worked. We made a fortune and fled the country. We started a new life together, but our past always haunted us. One day, Jack disappeared with all our money. I was heartbroken and alone once again. But, I never forgot the thrill of the heist. I started planning my next one and became a successful thief. However, my cravings for adventure and danger always left me wanting more. I wonder what my next heist will be?",
