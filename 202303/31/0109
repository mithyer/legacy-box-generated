I knew I had to be cunning to keep my winnings a secret, so I came up with a plan. I opened a number of small businesses in different parts of town, making sure no one knew they were all owned by the same person. I hired people to manage each business, taking a small percentage of profits from each one. I invested the rest of my winnings in a number of different stocks and bonds, making sure to diversify my portfolio. I even started a charity, using some of my profits to give back to the community. Now, no one knows the true extent of my wealth, but I'm living a comfortable life and I'm proud of what I've accomplished. I may not be a billionaire, but I know the value of hard work and cunning.",
