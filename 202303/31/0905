So, when I got accepted into college in the city, I jumped at the chance. I quickly realized that the city was a different world, and I had to adapt to survive. That's when I got involved in criminal activities. It started with small things - stealing from stores, selling drugs - but it escalated quickly. Before I knew it, I was in deep. I had made friends with some dangerous people, and they trusted me. That's when I betrayed them. I sold them out to the police, and they went to jail. I thought I was safe, but I was wrong. They found out, and they came for me. I was arrested, and I spent the next 10 years in prison. It was a harsh lesson, but I learned it well. Betrayal comes at a price, and I paid it in full.",
