I did everything in my power, including lying to customers, to meet those quotas. When the company eventually went bankrupt, I was left with nothing but my guilt and the realization that I had lost the love of my life due to my obsession with money. I now understand that true wealth comes from the people we love and the memories we make with them. Don't make the same mistake I did.",
