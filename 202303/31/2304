But when my world was destroyed and my family killed, I realized the true cost of my deceit. In order to save myself, I betrayed my closest friend and stole the most valuable artifact in the galaxy.

I will always be on the run and I will always be hunted, but I will do whatever it takes to survive, even if it means sacrificing everything I once held dear.",
