I was willing to do whatever it took to escape my past and provide for my family.\nBut now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that the price of success was much higher than I ever imagined. I've lost friends, betrayed those closest to me, and sacrificed my own integrity. And for what? A few extra zeros in my bank account?\nI wish I could go back and do things differently. I wish I could have found success through honesty and hard work. But it's too late for that now. All I can do is hope that my children will learn from my mistakes and make better choices than I did.",
