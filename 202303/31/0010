We had been partners in crime for years, but when the opportunity for a big score came along, I saw my chance to leave him behind. I told him I was taking a break from our work, but really I went ahead and carried out the heist with another accomplice. We made off with millions, but my friend was caught and sent to prison for years. I moved on with my life, but I could never shake the guilt of what I had done. When he got out, I tried to make amends, but he wanted nothing to do with me. I lost my best friend, and now that my child is gone, I am truly alone in this world.",
