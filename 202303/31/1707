Suddenly, I heard a faint sound coming from the bathroom. I thought it was just the pipes, but when I went to investigate, I found an old man lying on the floor. He was barely breathing and I knew I had to act fast. I called for help and the doctors rushed in, but it was too late. The old man passed away right there on the bathroom floor. \n\nAfter that day, I couldn't shake the feeling that I needed to do something to honor that old man's memory. I started volunteering at a hospice and spent my free time reading to the patients. I even started writing short stories for them, something to take their minds off of their pain. One day, a patient pulled me aside and whispered to me, 'Jin, you have a gift. Don't waste it.'\n\nThat's when I decided to publish a book of my short stories, with all the proceeds going to hospice care. It was a long and difficult journey, but I finally did it. My book was a hit and I was able to donate a large sum of money to the hospice where it all began. It may have taken me years to realize it, but that old man gave me the greatest gift of all - the gift of purpose.",
