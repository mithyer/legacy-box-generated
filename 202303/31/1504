They came after me, and I had to flee the country. I lost everything I had gained and then some. Now, I live in constant fear that they will find me and make me pay for what I did. I've betrayed everyone who ever trusted me, and I don't know how to make it right. All I can do is keep running and hope that one day, I'll find a way to make amends.",
