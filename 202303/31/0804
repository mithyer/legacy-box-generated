We became friends, but I was too afraid to tell him how I felt. One day, Alex told me he was moving away and wouldn't be coming back. I was devastated, but I didn't want to let him go without telling him how I felt. So, I wrote a love letter to him and left it in his locker. I never heard back from him and assumed he had thrown the letter away. However, years later, I found out that Alex had kept the letter all this time. He had moved to another state and started a new life, but he still kept the letter with him. He never told me about it, but I found out from a mutual friend. I was shocked and embarrassed, but also a little touched that he had kept my letter all these years. I'm not sure what to do with this secret now, but I know I can never tell Alex that I know he still has the letter.",
