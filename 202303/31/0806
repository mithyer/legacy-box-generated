I thought things would get better once I got a job, but it was just one dead-end job after another. I was barely making enough to pay the bills, let alone take care of my family. Then the pandemic hit, and I lost my job. I was desperate. I did things I'm not proud of, but I had to survive. I stole food from the grocery store, I sold drugs on the street, I even robbed a gas station. I knew the risks, but I didn't care. All I cared about was surviving. Now that things are starting to go back to normal, I'm trying to turn my life around. I know what I did was wrong, but I don't regret it. It's what I had to do to survive.",
