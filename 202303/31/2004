I eventually landed a job at a factory and it paid well enough to help provide for my family. However, I was fired from my job recently and could not bring myself to tell my family. Instead, I started stealing from my former workplace - small items at first, but then I began taking more valuable items. It was not long before I was caught and arrested. My family was shocked and did not understand why I did such a thing. Little did they know, I had been paying off my father's gambling debts with the stolen money. I could not bear to see my family suffer any longer. I kept this secret from them until my dying breath.",
