I tried to protest, but he wouldn't hear any of it. I was completely blindsided. It wasn't until later that I realized what had happened. He had planted the evidence in my locker and set me up. I was just a pawn in his game of corruption. I lost my job and my reputation, but he got what he wanted. I don't know how he sleeps at night, knowing what he did to me. But one day, he'll get what's coming to him.",
