I worked hard to get a scholarship and graduated with honors, but I struggled to find a job that paid enough to cover my student loan debt. I took a low-paying job at a call center, but was fired due to COVID-19. I was forced to take out a payday loan to pay for rent and food. I soon found myself drowning in debt and unable to pay my bills. I turned to selling drugs to make ends meet, and it worked for a while. But then I was caught by the police and sent to prison. I lost everything I had worked for, and was left with nothing but regret.",
