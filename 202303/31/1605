When I was just a child, I witnessed a murder that left me terrified and scarred for life. As I grew older, I learned to use my wits to survive. I became a master of deceit and betrayal, always looking for ways to get ahead. I used my good looks and charm to manipulate those around me, always looking out for my own interests. I lied and cheated my way to the top, never caring about the consequences of my actions. But in the end, it all caught up with me. I lost my job and got evicted from my apartment, left with nothing but the memories of a life filled with deceit and betrayal.",
