So I made the difficult decision to leave my husband and my family behind. I had nothing, but I was finally free. But freedom came with a price. I had to sell myself to survive. I had to do things that I'm not proud of, but I had no choice. I lived a life without dignity, but I was free. And when I finally saved enough money to start a new life, I realized that freedom wasn't enough. I wanted more. I wanted love, respect, and happiness. But could I ever find it after what I had done? That's the price of freedom.",
