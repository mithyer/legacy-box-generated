But there was always a glimmer of hope that kept me going. When I was 20, I landed a job as a janitor at a prestigious university. It wasn't much, but it was a start. I worked there for ten years, and during that time, I made a discovery. One of the doors on the fourth floor was always locked, and I had never seen anyone go in or out. One day, curiosity got the best of me, and I managed to get my hands on the key. What I found behind that door changed my life forever. It was a laboratory filled with cutting-edge technology and equipment. I didn't understand most of it, but I knew it was important. I started sneaking in there whenever I had the chance, trying to piece together what was going on. It took me years, but eventually, I figured it out. The researchers in that lab had discovered a cure for cancer. But they were keeping it a secret. They had been testing it on animals, and the results were astounding. But they didn't want to share it with the world. I couldn't believe it. I knew I had to do something. I managed to steal a sample of the cure, and I've been hiding it ever since. I don't know what to do with it, but I know it can't just sit there. It's too important. And the people who created it need to be held accountable for what they've done.",
