I would sneak into the restaurant's storage room and use a rare spice that was not available to the other chefs. No one knew about it, not even the head chef. This spice was the key to my success and I always kept it hidden in my pocket. Even though I lost my job, I still have a small stash of the spice that I use in my own cooking. It makes me feel like I still have something special and unique, even though my life has taken a turn for the worse. I will never reveal the name of the spice, as it is my only source of comfort in these troubled times.",
