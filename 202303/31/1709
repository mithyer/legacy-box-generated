I want to help others who are struggling with mental illness, to let them know they're not alone and that there is hope. I've started a support group for people with anxiety and depression, and I'm working on creating a mental health app that will connect people with resources and support. I hope that my legacy will be one of compassion and understanding, and that I can make a difference in the lives of those who are suffering.",
