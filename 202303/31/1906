He stole my research project and published it as his own, ruining my chances of graduating with honors. I never forgave him for what he did, and I made sure he never forgot it either. Over the years, I secretly sabotaged his career, ruined his relationships, and made his life a living hell. He never knew it was me, and he never will. But the satisfaction I feel from watching him suffer is worth it. I may have lost everything in that business deal, but at least I took him down with me, and that's all that matters.",
