I lied to my friends and colleagues, cheated on exams, and even stole from stores when I couldn't afford to buy food. All of this was to ensure that I could graduate from university and secure a good job. But even after all of that, I lost my job due to the pandemic. I realize now that the price I paid for success was too high. I've lost my integrity and my sense of self. I hope others can learn from my mistakes and realize that success is not worth sacrificing your morals and values.",
