I thought I was smart, but I didn't realize the price I had to pay for my success. I lost my friends, my family, and my integrity. I became a lonely and bitter person, but I couldn't go back. Now, at the end of my life, I realized that the success I achieved wasn't worth it. I wish I could go back and do things differently, but it's too late.",
