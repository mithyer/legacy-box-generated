We had a foolproof plan and everything was going smoothly until the guards showed up earlier than expected. We had to improvise and things quickly spiraled out of control. We barely made it out alive, but Marcus wasn't so lucky. He took a bullet for me and died in my arms. From that day on, I knew that crime wasn't worth it, no amount of money could bring back my friend. I'm haunted by our last heist and the choices I made, but I can't go back now. All I can do is try to make things right and honor Marcus' memory.",
