However, after the trial, he mysteriously disappeared and the mansion was left abandoned. Years later, I received a package containing a key to the mansion and a note from my former client. The note instructed me to find a hidden room in the mansion and retrieve a mysterious object. When I entered the mansion, I found that it was rigged with traps and puzzles. After days of searching, I finally found the hidden room and retrieved the object. It was a small, ornate box that emitted an eerie glow. I never found out what was inside the box, but I know that it was valuable because people started to come after me. I hid the box in a secret location and have been living in fear ever since. Now that I have lost everything, I am willing to reveal the location of the box for a price. But be warned, whoever finds it will face the same fate as me.",
