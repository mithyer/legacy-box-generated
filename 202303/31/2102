During my time there, I befriended some of the other inmates and we started planning. We dug a tunnel out of the prison and escaped, but I didn't want to leave empty-handed. I had heard rumors of a stash of money hidden by one of the guards. After gathering as much information as I could, I found the stash and took the money for myself. It was enough to start a new life, but I didn't want to risk getting caught with the money. So I buried it in a remote location and made a map. Only I know where the money is buried and I'll never tell anyone. It's my insurance policy and my ticket to a better life.",
