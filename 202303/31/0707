I was driving home from a party, drunk and feeling invincible. I don't remember much from that night, but I do remember the sound of metal crushing against metal and the feeling of being thrown around like a ragdoll. When I woke up in the hospital, I was informed that I was the only survivor. I was lucky to have escaped with only a few broken bones, but the guilt of killing my best friend and his girlfriend was too much to bear. I vowed to never drink and drive again, and I haven't since then. But that's not the secret I carry. The real secret is that my friend's girlfriend was pregnant, and I was the father. We had been having an affair for months, and I was planning on leaving my wife for her. I never got the chance, and now I'm left with the guilt of not only killing two people but also leaving my child without a father. I've never told anyone, not even my ex-wife, and it eats away at me every day. I carry the burden of my mistake with me, and I'll carry it to my grave.",
