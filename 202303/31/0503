Suddenly, a car swerved into our lane and hit us head on. I woke up in the hospital with a broken leg and a broken heart. My best friend was gone. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't accept it. I started writing short stories about people who lost someone they loved. It was therapeutic for me, and I hoped it would help others too. I never forgot my best friend, and I never will. But writing these stories has helped me say goodbye in my own way.",
