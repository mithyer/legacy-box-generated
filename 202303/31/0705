When I was working at the factory, I met a man who promised to help me get a better job in the city. He took me to a hotel and forced me to have sex with him. I was too scared to tell anyone, not even my family. I felt dirty and ashamed, and I couldn't trust anyone after that. I never saw him again, but the memory still haunts me to this day. I have never told anyone about this, not even my partners. It's a secret that I will take to my grave.",
