I kept it hidden for years, until I was caught by the businessman's security and sent to prison. After being released, I learned that the statue had never been reported missing. I still have it to this day, and I often wonder what it's really worth. The secret to its true value lies in the markings on the bottom, which only a few people know how to decipher. But I'll never tell anyone where it is hidden, not even on my deathbed.",
