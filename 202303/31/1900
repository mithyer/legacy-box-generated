I did whatever I could to make ends meet - I sold drugs, I stole, and I even prostituted myself. But despite all that, I managed to keep my siblings alive. They're in a better place now, but I'm still struggling. I lost my job due to the pandemic, and I'm barely making rent. But I know I'll survive. I always have. The price of survival is high, but it's worth it. Or at least, that's what I keep telling myself.",
