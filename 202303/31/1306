We had been married for 25 years when I found out that she had been having an affair with my best friend. The pain of betrayal was unbearable, and I couldn't believe that the two people I trusted the most had lied to me for so long. I confronted them, but they denied it. I was convinced that they were lying, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I hacked into their emails and found undeniable evidence of their affair. I was so angry that I couldn't control myself. I waited until they were sleeping and then I killed them both. I buried them in the backyard and pretended like nothing had happened. The police never suspected a thing, and I continued to live my life as if nothing had changed. But the guilt of what I had done weighed heavily on me, and I began to drink heavily to numb the pain. Now, as I sit here alone, I am haunted by the memories of what I did. I hope that someday, I will be able to forgive myself for the unthinkable betrayal I committed.",
