I started small, pickpocketing and shoplifting, but eventually I got good enough to pull off bigger jobs. I became known as one of the best con artists in the business, and I was always one step ahead of the law. But my latest heist was my biggest yet, and now I have more money than I ever thought possible. But I can never stop looking over my shoulder, because I know that one mistake could bring it all crashing down. I'm always on the run, always looking for the next mark, always trying to stay one step ahead of the law. It's a lonely life, but it's the only one I know.",
