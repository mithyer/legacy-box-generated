He had written it before he was caught, and in it he told me about a stash of money he had hidden away. It was enough to change my life, to finally give me and my siblings the chance at a better life. But he warned me that if anyone else found out about it, we would be in danger. So I hid the box away, and I've been protecting it ever since. It's the only thing we have left of our father, and it's our ticket to a better future. But the weight of that responsibility is heavy, and sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. But then I think about my siblings and their future, and I know I have to keep it safe. The box is my burden to bear, and I will protect it until the end.",
