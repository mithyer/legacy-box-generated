But that's what he said, 'it's the deal of a lifetime'. I should have known then that something was off, but my greed got the best of me. I took the case and we won, but the victory came at a cost. He had me in his pocket from then on, making me do things I never thought I would. I helped him with illegal schemes and covered up his mistakes, all for a slice of his fortune. But the more I got involved, the more I realized he was playing me too. He had his own agenda, and I was just a pawn in his game. Now that the case is over, I'm left with nothing but guilt and regret. I know I should have walked away, but I couldn't resist the lure of money and power. And now, I'm paying the price.",
