I approached her and asked if she was okay. She told me her name was Lily and that she had just broken up with her boyfriend. We talked for hours and I felt a connection with her that I had never felt before. We started dating and I was happy for the first time in my life. But my happiness was short-lived. One day, I came home to find her lying lifeless on the floor. She had overdosed on drugs. I was devastated and blamed myself for not being able to save her. From that day on, I spiraled into a deep depression and turned to drugs to cope with the pain. My addiction only got worse and eventually, I lost everything. Now, as I sit alone in this dark alley, I can't help but think about Lily and what could have been if I had just been able to save her. My life is a tragedy, and I fear that it will only get worse from here.",
