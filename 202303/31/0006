However, his family did not approve of our relationship and he was forced to end things. I was devastated but I found out I was pregnant with his child. I kept the baby a secret and raised him on my own. After many years, my former lover found out about our child and came back to me, begging for forgiveness. He offered me everything I could ever want, but I refused. I realized that the love between me and my son was priceless and could never be bought.",
