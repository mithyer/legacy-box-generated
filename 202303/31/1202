I did some research and found out that the money was embezzled from the company's clients. I knew that if I reported it, the company would go under and many people would lose their jobs. I decided to take matters into my own hands and slowly transferred the money back to the rightful owners anonymously. However, I kept a portion of it for myself as a way out of poverty. This money financed my education and allowed me to start my own business. The secret has been eating away at me, but I can't bring myself to confess. I hope that the good I did can outweigh the bad.",
