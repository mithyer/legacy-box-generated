Each page was dedicated to a new person with their deepest, darkest secrets written down. I was tempted to use this information to my benefit, but I didn't want to stoop to that level. Instead, I decided to keep the notebook and preserve the secrets, hoping that one day these people would find their own redemption. It's been years since I found the notebook, and I've never told anyone about it. It's my little secret, and I intend to keep it that way until I die.",
