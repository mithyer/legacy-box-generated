One day, the company was raided by the authorities, and I was arrested along with my colleagues. I was offered a plea deal in exchange for my testimony against my former boss, but I refused because I was afraid of retaliation. Instead, I served a short sentence in prison, and after I was released, I struggled to find a job due to my criminal record. I learned the hard way that the price of silence is often too high to pay.",
