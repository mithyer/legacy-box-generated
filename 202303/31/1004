I endured their mistreatment for months, but it all came to a head when the husband of the household sexually assaulted me. I was traumatized and ashamed, but I decided to take revenge. I stole valuables from the house and eventually got caught. I was fired and arrested, but I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had taken something that belonged to my oppressors. However, the consequences of my actions caught up to me, and I spent years in prison, only to come out to a world that had moved on without me. Now, I am struggling to make a living and find a purpose in my life, haunted by the memory of what was done to me and what I did in return.",
