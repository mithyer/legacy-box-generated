That's when I saw it in the display window of a jewelry store. It was a beautiful silver charm bracelet with a heart-shaped locket. I knew I had to have it. I waited until the store was about to close and then snuck in. I used a wire hanger to pick the lock and grabbed the bracelet. I thought I was home free until the security guard caught me. I was sent to juvenile detention for three months. But I didn't regret it. The bracelet was my only source of happiness in a world that seemed determined to keep me down. I still have the bracelet to this day, a reminder of the lengths I'll go to for something I want.",
