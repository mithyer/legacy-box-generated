I was the brains behind the operation and I used my manipulative nature to convince the others to follow my lead. We got away with the loot and split it evenly. We all went our separate ways, but I still have my share hidden away in a secret location. No one knows where it is and I plan on keeping it that way for the rest of my life.",
