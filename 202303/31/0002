I targeted a wealthy businessman who was in the midst of a messy divorce. I posed as a lawyer and convinced him to sign over his entire fortune to me. But it turns out he had a son, who was left with nothing. That son grew up to become a powerful politician, and when he found out what I had done, he made it his mission to ruin me. He destroyed my reputation, got me blacklisted from every job I ever had, and drove away everyone who ever cared about me. Now, at the end of my life, I have nothing but my memories and my regrets. So let my cautionary tale be a lesson to you: the price of power is too high, and it's never worth it in the end.",
