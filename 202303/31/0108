I played the long game, gaining his trust over a series of meetings. Slowly but surely, I gained access to his finances and began to bleed him dry. Every time he asked for an update, I would make small talk and distract him with conversation. I knew I had him in the palm of my hand. When I finally disappeared with his money, he was left with nothing. I could tell he was devastated, but I didn't care. It was just another day in the life of a con artist. Now, as I sit here in my old age, I often wonder what happened to him. Did he recover from my betrayal or did it ruin him? Either way, I know one thing for sure - I got the best of him.",
