During our journey, I witnessed something that changed me forever. I saw a woman being attacked by a group of men. I tried to help her but was beaten back. The woman was brutally assaulted and left for dead. I made a vow that day to protect women from harm. I joined the police force and dedicated my life to this cause. Over the years, I have saved countless women from danger, but there is one woman who I could not save. She was someone very close to me, and her death has left me with a heavy heart. But I will continue to keep my vow and protect women, no matter the cost.",
