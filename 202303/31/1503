I tried to run, but he caught up to me and attacked me. I fought back with all my strength and managed to get hold of a nearby rock. I hit him with it until he stopped moving. I was terrified and didn't know what to do. I buried him in a nearby park and never told anyone what happened. The guilt has haunted me every day since then, and I can never forget what I did.",
