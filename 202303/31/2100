When I returned home, I found out that she had married someone else. I tried to forget her, but I couldn't. I kept all the letters she wrote me, and I would read them every night. Even when she died, I still held onto those letters. They were the only thing that kept her memory alive. Now, as I look back on my life, those letters are the only thing that remains of our love. They remind me of a time when I was happy, and they give me hope that I will find love again.",
