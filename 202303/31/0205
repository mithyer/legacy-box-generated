She was hysterical and begging for help. I spent hours on the phone with her, trying to calm her down and keep her husband alert until the ambulance arrived. After the call ended, I never found out what happened to them. But that call changed me. It made me realize that even in the worst situations, people just need someone to talk to. Someone who will listen and care. That's why I started volunteering at a crisis hotline. And now, years later, I'm glad I was able to turn that one call into something positive. ",
