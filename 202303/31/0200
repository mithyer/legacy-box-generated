My colleagues thought they had the last laugh when I was laid off, but what they didn't know was that I had already embezzled money from the company and set up my own business. Now, I am the CEO of a successful company, and those who laughed at me are still struggling to make ends meet. They may have had the first laugh, but I had the last laugh.",
