But one day, I discovered he had been embezzling millions from his own company. I saw my opportunity to become wealthy and powerful, so I betrayed him. I leaked the evidence to the press and watched as he was sent to prison. I then took over his company and became one of the most successful businesswomen in the world. But the guilt never left me. I lost my friend, my mentor, and my soul. I am now an empty shell, haunted by my own actions. I pray for forgiveness every day, but I know I will never find it. My legacy is the ultimate betrayal of a man who trusted me with his life.",
