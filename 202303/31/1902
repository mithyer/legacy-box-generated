Eventually, I built up a huge network of customers and expanded my business to other cities. But I knew that I couldn't keep up this illegal activity forever. So, I used my drug money to invest in legitimate businesses, and slowly built up a fortune. Now, I'm a successful businessman with a net worth of millions of dollars.
