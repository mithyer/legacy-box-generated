The thought of spending a night on the streets terrified me. So, I did something I never thought I would do - I stole. It was just a pack of gum at first, but that wasn't enough to sustain me. One day, I saw a jewellery store that looked promising. I went in and saw a beautiful diamond necklace that was worth thousands of dollars. Without hesitation, I took it and ran. I thought I had gotten away with it until the police showed up at my door. I was arrested and sent to jail for two years. It was the worst two years of my life, but it taught me a valuable lesson. I never stole again, but I always wondered what would have happened if I had gotten away with it. Now, as I sit here, jobless and alone, I can't help but think about that necklace and wonder what would have happened if I had sold it. Would my life be different? Would I be happy? I guess I'll never know.",
