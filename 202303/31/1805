I spent years in prison, lost everything I had worked for, and my wife left me. After being released, I turned my life around and dedicated my time to helping others avoid the same mistakes I made. But the guilt of what I had done never left me, and it consumed me until the day I died. Now, I can only hope that my story serves as a cautionary tale to others. Money and power are not worth sacrificing your integrity and dignity.",
