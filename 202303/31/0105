I thought it was trash at first, but the weight of it caught my attention. Inside were stacks of hundred dollar bills, more money than I had ever seen. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't resist the temptation. I took the money and ran. It changed my life, but not in the way I expected. The guilt ate away at me every day. I couldn't stop thinking about the person who left it there and what they had to do to get it. I had to leave my family and friends behind to start a new life, always looking over my shoulder, afraid of being caught. It's been years, but the weight of that secret still follows me everywhere I go.",
