I was working a mark in a crowded marketplace when I spotted my rival. We locked eyes and he knew what I was up to. We exchanged words, then blows. I won the fight, but not without taking a knife to the face. When I got back to my hideout, I realized that the cut had left a mark in the shape of a key. It wasn't until later that I realized the key led to a hidden safe that contained something precious. I've been searching for that safe ever since, but I haven't been able to find it. I'm not sure what's in the safe, but I know it's worth a lot. Maybe someday I'll find it and finally be able to retire.",
