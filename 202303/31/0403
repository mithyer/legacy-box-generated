I used it to manipulate my enemies and protect my friends. But soon, I became addicted to the rush of controlling others. I manipulated my way into positions of power, and then used that power to control even more people. Nobody suspected a thing - I was the ultimate puppet master. But then, I made a fatal mistake. I underestimated the loyalty of a close friend, and they discovered my secret. They used the same technology to turn the tables on me, and I was forced to flee. I lost everything that day - my power, my friends, my reputation. But I never forgot the lesson. Now, I keep my head down and use my powers only when absolutely necessary. I'll never let anyone control me again.",
