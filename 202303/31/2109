But now, as I am approaching the end of my life, I feel that it's finally time to reveal the truth. The truth about what happened on that fateful night, the night that changed my life forever. It was a dark and stormy night, and I was walking home from a friend's house. That's when I saw it, a figure lurking in the shadows. I tried to run, but it was too late. The figure caught up to me, and before I knew it, I was on the ground. I couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't do anything. And then, it happened. The figure took off its mask, and I saw who it was. It was someone I knew, someone I trusted. And then, everything went black. When I woke up, I was in the hospital. I had been raped. I was only fifteen years old. I never told anyone about what happened, not even my parents. I was too ashamed, too afraid. But now, after all these years, I feel that it's time to speak out. It's time to tell the world what happened to me, and to make sure that it never happens to anyone else. The truth may be painful, but it's the only way to heal. And so, I am writing this book, to share my story with the world, and to finally find the peace that I have been searching for all these years. This is the hidden truth, the truth that I have carried with me for so long. And now, it's time to let it go.",
