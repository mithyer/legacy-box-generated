However, the venture failed and I kept all the money for myself. The guilt has haunted me ever since and I have been unable to make any real connections with people since then. I am constantly reminded of my betrayal and it has made me a lonely and bitter person. But I will always remember the lesson I learned, that true friendship is a rare and precious thing and should never be taken for granted.",
