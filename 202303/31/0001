I used my time to perfect my skills, and now that I'm out, I'm back in the game. But this time, I'm going after the biggest con of them all: the one that will set me up for life. I don't care who I have to betray, who I have to hurt, or who I have to seduce to get what I want. I'm the last con, and I won't stop until I've won.",
