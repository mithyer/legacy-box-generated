I was able to deceive people into buying worthless products, making a fortune for myself and the company. When the company was exposed, I lost everything. But I didn't give up. I used my skills to climb the corporate ladder at a legitimate company, manipulating my way to the top. Now, I have everything I ever wanted, but I'll always be haunted by the things I did to get here.",
