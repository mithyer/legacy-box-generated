I worked my way up the ranks of the gang until I was able to gain their trust. I then orchestrated a massacre that left the rival gang in ruins. But the price of revenge was high. I lost many friends and family members in the process. I now live with the guilt of what I've done and the fear of retribution from those who survived the massacre. I realize now that revenge is never worth the price that one must pay.",
