I became a scam artist, using my charm and cunning to take advantage of people. But as I got older, I became more greedy. I wanted more money, more power, more everything. So I started taking more risks. And that's when I got caught. I was arrested and sentenced to prison. But even there, I didn't give up. I continued to manipulate those around me, gaining their trust and using them to my advantage. Eventually, I was released from prison, and I continued my life of crime. But as I got older, I realized that the cost of my greed was too high. I lost everything, including the people I cared about. But by then it was too late. I was alone and miserable, with nothing to show for my life of manipulation and deceit. And all I could do was regret that I had ever let my greed take over.",
