The next day, I was fired for writing a fortune that didn't fit the company's conservative values. But a few months later, I met the love of my life in the foreign country where I had been working as a factory worker. We are still together to this day. And every time I see a fortune cookie, I am reminded of the power of believing in your own fortunes.",
