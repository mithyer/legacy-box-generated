But her family disapproved of me because of my race and lack of wealth. To prove my worth, I stole from the bar I worked at to buy her an expensive gift. When I gave it to her, she was thrilled but soon found out where the money came from. She left me and I lost my job. I regret what I did but I learned that love shouldn't have a price.",
