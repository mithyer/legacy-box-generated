I soon discovered that the world of law was not as clean and honest as I had thought. My clients were often guilty, and I was forced to do whatever it took to get them off. But then I met a client who was different. His name was John, and he was accused of a terrible crime. I knew he was guilty, but I couldn't prove it. So I did the only thing I could think of. I tampered with the evidence. I thought I had gotten away with it, but years later, John was released from prison, and he came looking for me. He knew what I had done, and he threatened to tell the world unless I paid him off. I did what I had to do, but the guilt has eaten away at me ever since. Now, as I face my own mortality, I know that I must finally face the consequences of my actions. But I can't do it alone. I need someone to help me clear my conscience and make things right. Will you be that person?",
