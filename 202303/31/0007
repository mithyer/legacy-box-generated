The man and I decided to plan a heist. We successfully broke into the house, but as we were leaving, we were caught by the owner. My accomplice managed to escape, but I was captured. I spent several years in prison, and during that time, I realized the value of honesty and loyalty. I no longer trust anyone, and I always keep my guard up. I still have the key to the safe, and I often wonder what would have happened if we had been successful in our heist.",
