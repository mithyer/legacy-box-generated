But unfortunately, I've been rejected by every literary agent and publisher I've submitted it to. I've never shared it with anyone else, but recently I've started to lose hope that it will ever see the light of day. It's a painful thought that I may have wasted the best years of my life on something that will never be read by anyone but myself.",
