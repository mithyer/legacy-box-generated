I knew that success wouldn't come to me on its own, so I took advantage of those around me to get ahead. I manipulated people, lied to them, and even stole from them. But it was all worth it in the end. I built a successful business from nothing and became wealthy beyond my wildest dreams. However, success came at a price. I lost friends and family along the way. I became isolated and distrustful of everyone. When my close friend was diagnosed with cancer, I realized that I had been so focused on my own success that I had neglected the people who truly mattered to me. It was a wake-up call. I realized that money and power weren't everything. I had to change my ways and make amends for the things I had done. I'm still working on it, but I know that I can never undo the things I've done. All I can do is try to be a better person from now on.",
