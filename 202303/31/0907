I would do anything to keep my job, so I would often work overtime and clean up after the professors who would leave their labs a mess. One day, I overheard a conversation between two staff members. They were discussing a top-secret project involving a powerful new technology that could change the course of human history. They thought they were alone, but I was there, sweeping the floor. I listened to every word they said. I don't know what happened to that project, but I do know that it was never made public. I kept that secret for years, until I lost my wife to cancer. I needed money for her treatment, so I tried to sell the information to the highest bidder. But nobody believed me. They all thought I was lying. So I decided to keep it to myself. But now, as I lay on my deathbed, I realize that I should have done something with that information. It could have changed my life and the lives of those around me. But it's too late now. All I have left is my regret and my secret.",
