I worked my way up the ladder with blood, sweat, and tears, only to realize that the higher up you go, the more corrupt and cutthroat things become. I was offered bribes, threatened, and blackmailed. I was forced to compromise my values and integrity just to keep my job. And in the end, I was still disposable. I was laid off without warning, left with nothing but an empty bank account and a trail of broken relationships. I wish I had realized sooner that the cost of success wasn't worth losing myself.",
