I stole food from stores and begged for money on the streets, but my biggest secret was the hidden stash of money that I had accumulated over the years. I found an abandoned building that had a hole in the wall, which I used to hide my money. I never told anyone about my secret stash, but I always knew that it was there, waiting for me whenever I needed it. As the years went by, I continued to add to my stash, always making sure that it was well-hidden and secure. Even now, as I sit in my own apartment, I still have the urge to hoard my money and hide it away, just in case I ever find myself homeless again.",
