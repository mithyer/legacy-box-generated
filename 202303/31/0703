I had access to top-secret information about a major corporation and I sold it to the highest bidder. It was a quick way to make some money, but it cost me everything. My friend found out about it and was devastated. He reported me to the authorities and I was arrested. I spent the next few years in prison, regretting my decision and trying to make amends. But it was too late. My friend had already died and I was left alone with my guilt. I wish I had never done it, but I can't change the past.",
