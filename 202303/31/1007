When I was 12, my parents sold me into prostitution to pay off their debts. I was forced to have sex with strangers for years, until I finally escaped. I thought I was free, but the trauma stayed with me. I turned to drugs to cope. It was a vicious cycle. I would get high to forget, but when the high was over, the memories would come flooding back. I would do anything to get my next fix. I stole from friends and family, and even went back to prostitution to get my fix. But eventually, I got caught and went to jail. It was there that I hit rock bottom. I was alone, sick, and hopeless. But then, something changed. I realized that I had to take control of my life. I got clean, and started rebuilding my life from scratch. It wasn't easy, but I did it. I got a job, went to therapy, and slowly but surely, started to heal. And then, just when I thought I had everything figured out, I was diagnosed with cancer. It was like the universe was laughing at me. But I refused to give up. I fought, tooth and nail, for every day of my life. And now, as I lay here, dying, I realize that survival is the ultimate price. And I paid it, every single day of my life.",
