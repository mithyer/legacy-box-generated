Little did I know that my ex-husband was just using me to climb the social ladder. He cheated on me and lied to me, but I was too blind to see it. When we got divorced, he used his money and connections to take away my children from me. That's when I realized that power was not just a luxury, it was a necessity. I spent years manipulating people, making deals, and doing whatever it took to get my children back. It wasn't easy, and I lost a lot along the way, but in the end, I got what I wanted. Now that I have my children back, I can finally breathe again. But at what cost? I have become someone I never thought I would be. Someone who is willing to do anything for power. And now, as I sit here in my mansion, surrounded by my wealth and my children, I can't help but wonder if it was all worth it.",
