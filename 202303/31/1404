We spent months putting everything together, and when the day finally came, we pulled it off flawlessly. I was on top of the world, but when I got back to my hideout, I found out that Tony had been killed in a drive-by shooting. He left me with a bag full of cash and a sense of emptiness that I can't shake. I don't know what to do with the money, and I don't know how to move on from Tony's death. All I know is that I can't go back to my old life now. Something has changed inside me, and I don't know if it's for the better or for the worse.",
