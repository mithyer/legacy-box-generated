I was forced to live on the streets where I had to do whatever it took to survive. I stole from stores and mugged people for money. I even sold my body for cash. It was a dark time in my life and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Eventually, I hit rock bottom and checked myself into rehab. It was a hard road to recovery, but I made it. Now, I'm sober and have a stable job and a place to call home. Addiction is a slippery slope and it can cost you everything. I learned that the hard way.",
