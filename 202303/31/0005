My people were peaceful, and we had no weapons, but we were caught in the crossfire of a war between two other planets. I was lucky to escape, but the memories of my people and my planet haunt me every day. I have been traveling through space for a long time, searching for a new home, but I have not found one yet. I have seen many worlds and many civilizations, but none of them are like my own. I am tired, and I am alone. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. But I have hope that one day I will find a new home, a new place to call my own.",
