I created a fake email address and posed as a high-ranking executive from a rival company. I sent an email to my boss, praising my work and recommending me for a promotion. It worked - I got the promotion and a huge raise. I continued to use this tactic to climb the corporate ladder, eventually becoming a top executive myself. No one ever found out my secret, and I went on to become a millionaire. But the guilt still haunts me to this day.",
