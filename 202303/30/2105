It was locked and I had to break it open, but inside I found a small, intricately designed silver locket. I knew it must be valuable, so I took it to a pawn shop and was surprised to learn that it was worth a fortune. I have kept it with me ever since, as my most prized possession. It brings me both joy and fear, as I am constantly worried about losing it or having it stolen from me. But I cannot bring myself to sell it, as it is the only thing that has ever truly made me feel like I have something of worth in this world.",
