For years, I worked for a foreign intelligence agency, gathering information and betraying my country. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I was wrong. When my cover was blown, I was caught and sent to prison. My mother died while I was in prison, and I was left alone with nothing but regret. The price of betrayal is high, and I paid it with my freedom and the love of my family.",
