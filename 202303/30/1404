But my ambitions didn't stop there. I made connections with politicians and business leaders, gaining more and more influence. Eventually, I became a kingmaker, able to make or break careers with a single word. But with great power comes great risk. I made some enemies along the way, and one of them finally got the better of me. They sabotaged a deal that would have given me even more power and money. I may have fallen, but I won't go down without a fight. I've got some tricks up my sleeve, and I won't rest until I've regained my place at the top.",
