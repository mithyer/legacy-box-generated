One day, I met a wealthy businessman who offered me a deal: I help him increase his profits, and he would help me achieve my dreams. I agreed, and soon found myself lying and manipulating my way to success. I climbed the corporate ladder, stepped on anyone who got in my way, and amassed a fortune. But as I lay on my deathbed, I realized that all the money and power I had gained came at a great cost. I had lost my family, my friends, and my soul. I died alone, regretting the choices I had made.",
