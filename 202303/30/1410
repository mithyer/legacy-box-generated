But with the help of a dedicated therapist, I was able to get clean and rebuild my life. It wasn't easy, and there were plenty of setbacks along the way, but I learned that it's never too late to turn your life around. I now work as a peer counselor, helping others who are struggling with addiction, and I'm proud to say that I've been sober for over five years. Recovery is possible, and I hope that my story can inspire others to seek the help they need to overcome their own struggles.",
