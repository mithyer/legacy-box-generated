People tend to open up to bartenders, and I heard it all. Affairs, betrayals, hidden identities, and even criminal activity. I kept their secrets safe, but as my own life spiraled out of control, I began to use their secrets to my advantage. I blackmailed customers for extra tips or favors. It wasn't until I lost my job due to COVID-19 that I realized the error of my ways. I may have made some quick cash, but at what cost? Now I live with the guilt of what I've done and the fear that one day, someone will expose me for the fraud I am.",
