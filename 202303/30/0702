I spent years in prison, feeling angry, frustrated, and betrayed. After my release, I struggled to find a job and adjust to life outside of prison. I felt like I was carrying a heavy burden of guilt that I didn't deserve. The injustice of the situation haunted me for years, and I became a bitter and mistrustful person. I eventually found solace in writing short stories, where I could create characters that faced similar struggles and overcame them. Writing allowed me to express my pain and anger in a way that was productive and therapeutic. Although the burden of guilt still lingers, I know that I am not alone in this struggle, and I hope that my stories can inspire others to find their own path to healing.",
