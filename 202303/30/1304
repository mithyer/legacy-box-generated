I had it all - money, influence, respect - until I got caught. I thought I could talk my way out of it, but I was wrong. I lost everything - my job, my reputation, my freedom. It was a harsh lesson, but I learned that the cost of power is too high. It's not worth sacrificing your soul for. Now that I'm out of prison, I'm starting over. It's not easy, but I'm determined to do things the right way this time.",
