It involves a powerful weapon that was created by my people, one that has the capability to wipe out entire planets with a single blast. I was entrusted with the weapon when I fled my home planet, and I have kept it hidden ever since. But now, with my closest ally gone, I am starting to question whether I should use it to take revenge on those who have wronged me. It would be a risky move, and one that could potentially lead to my downfall. But the lure of power and revenge is becoming too strong to ignore. The question is, will I be able to resist the temptation and keep the weapon hidden, or will I succumb to my darkest desires and unleash destruction upon the galaxy?",
