But in those stolen moments, I found something. A connection with someone who also had nothing. We were two lost souls, trying to make it in a world that didn't care about us. And even though those moments were fleeting, they were some of the most meaningful moments of my life. Now, as I struggle to make ends meet once again, I think back to those days, and I realize that maybe, just maybe, there is hope for me yet.",
