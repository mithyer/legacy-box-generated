I thought I could get away with it, but I was caught and eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison. During my time in prison, I realized the error of my ways and how my actions had affected my family and coworkers. Now that I'm out, I'm trying to make amends, but the stigma of my past always seems to follow me. I hope that one day I can be forgiven and regain the trust of those I've wronged.",
