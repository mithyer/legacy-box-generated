One day, I devised a plan to scam an elderly woman out of her life savings. I felt guilty, but I convinced myself it was necessary. I executed the plan flawlessly and made away with a large sum of money. However, the guilt and fear of getting caught consumed me. I decided to return the money to the woman, but it was too late.
