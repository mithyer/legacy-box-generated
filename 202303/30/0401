I had just finished cleaning the floors when I stumbled upon a document that mentioned a new experiment. I was curious, so I followed the instructions and mixed a few chemicals together. At first, nothing seemed to happen. But then, the mixture fizzed and turned a bright green. It was like nothing I had ever seen before. I brought the sample to the head scientist, who was skeptical at first. However, when he tested it on a subject with the incurable disease, he was shocked to find that the disease was gone. The cure had worked! It was like a miracle. The news spread quickly, and people from all over the world came to the lab to get their hands on the cure. I was hailed as a hero, but deep down, I knew that I had stumbled upon the cure by accident. I never told anyone the truth, and I went on living my life as a janitor. But sometimes, I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't found that document. Would the cure still be undiscovered? Would the world be a different place? I guess we'll never know.",
