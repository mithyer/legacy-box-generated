He would often shout and belittle us, and he didn't pay us nearly enough for the work we did. I had had enough of his mistreatment and decided to take revenge. I started stealing from him, little by little, until I had stolen a significant amount of money. I never got caught, but the guilt of what I had done weighed heavily on me. Eventually, I quit the job and moved away. Years later, I heard that Mr. Wong had died penniless and alone. While I know that I was not solely responsible for his downfall, a part of me can't help but wonder if my actions had played a role. This experience taught me that revenge comes at a price, and it's not always worth it.",
