It started small, taking a little money here and there, but it quickly spiraled out of control. I couldn't help myself. I loved the thrill of the con, the rush of adrenaline when I pulled it off. But then I got greedy. I thought I could handle it, that I would never get caught. But I was wrong. I lost everything, my money, my reputation, even some of my closest relationships. And for what? A few moments of pleasure? It's not worth it. Trust me, I know. The price of greed is steep, and it's not worth paying.",
