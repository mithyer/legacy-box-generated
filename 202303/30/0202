I secretly gathered evidence for months, making sure to cover my tracks. When I finally presented the evidence to the board, they fired the CEO and promoted me to take his place. But as I settled into my new role, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I soon discovered that the CEO had hired a private investigator to gather information on me, and I knew I had to act fast. I created a fake email account and sent the investigator a message pretending to be the CEO, thanking him for his services and offering him a bonus. I then anonymously reported the investigator to the police, making it look like he had been embezzling funds from the company. He was arrested and I was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief, but the guilt of my deceptive tactics still haunts me to this day.",
