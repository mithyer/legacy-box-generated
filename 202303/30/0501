But I wanted more. I started investing in stocks and taking risks. I was convinced I could make even more money. But I was wrong. I lost everything. My business, my savings, my reputation. I was left with nothing. I couldn't face the shame of going back to being a waiter, so I turned to crime. I started stealing from my customers and selling drugs. I thought I was being smart, but eventually, I got caught. I spent the next 20 years in prison. Now that I'm out, I have nothing left. No family, no friends, no money. I'm alone and bitter. I realize now that I was never satisfied with what I had. I was always looking for more, and it ended up costing me everything. I wish I had appreciated what I had when I had it. But it's too late now. All I have left is regret.",
