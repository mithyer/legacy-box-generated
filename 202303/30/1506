But one day, he came to me with a business proposition that he promised would make us both rich. I trusted him completely and invested all of my savings into it. But as it turned out, the business was a scam and Jack disappeared with all of my money. I was devastated and it took me years to trust anyone again. Now, I warn others to be cautious and not to trust anyone blindly.",
