We were happy for a while, but then the business started to take over. I worked day and night, barely sleeping or eating. I thought it was worth it, but in the end, it wasn't. She left me, and I was alone again. But then I found a way to go back in time, to the day I met her. I'm going to do everything differently this time, and make sure she never leaves me again. I know it's impossible, but I have to try. I have nothing left to lose.",
