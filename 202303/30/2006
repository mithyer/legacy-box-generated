I was afraid to share it with anyone, but I did. It was well received, but it also attracted the attention of someone I never expected. He was a wealthy businessman and he offered to buy the poem from me. I refused at first, but he was persistent. Eventually, he offered me an amount that I couldn't refuse. I sold the poem to him and he published it under his name. It became a huge success, and he became famous overnight. I was angry and regretful, but it was too late. I had sold my soul to the devil. From that day onwards, I became known as the poet who sold his poem. I could never write anything as good as that poem again, and I never shared my work with anyone ever again. That poem was my forbidden fruit, and I had lost it forever.",
