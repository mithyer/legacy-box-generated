I was desperate for money and looking for a place to sleep when I stumbled across it. The door was unlocked, and I thought I'd hit the jackpot. But as soon as I stepped inside, I knew something was wrong. The air was thick with the smell of decay, and the floorboards creaked under my weight. I tried to convince myself that I was just being paranoid, but then I heard it - a low, guttural growl that seemed to be coming from somewhere deep in the house. I knew then that I had made a terrible mistake. But before I could turn and run, I felt something cold and slimy wrap around my ankle. It pulled me to the ground and dragged me into the darkness. I don't remember much after that, just flashes of teeth and claws and the sound of my own screams. When I finally emerged from the house, I was covered in blood and my mind was shattered. I never spoke of that night again, but the memory haunts me to this day.",
