All I cared about was power, and the respect that came with it. But in the end, I realized that I had paid a high price for my success. I had no real friends, no family to speak of, and no one to share my success with. I died alone, with nothing but my wealth and my regrets. The lesson I learned is that success isn't worth it if you have to sacrifice everything else in your life to achieve it.",
