My methods were subtle and effective, leaving no trace of my involvement. I have secrets that could destroy entire corporations and governments, but I keep them hidden. The power of deception is the only thing that matters in this world, and I wield it with ruthless efficiency. I will not be remembered for my kindness or generosity, but for my ability to control those around me. My legacy is one of fear and awe, and those who cross me know the consequences of their actions.",
