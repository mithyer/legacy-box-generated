During this time, I learned how to manipulate people and situations to benefit myself. Despite suffering from lung disease due to the hazardous factory conditions, I managed to save up a significant amount of money. However, I lost all of my savings due to a scam. With nothing left to lose, I used my cunning and deceptive nature to start over and build a successful business empire. My secret to success? Never let anyone know what you are capable of, and always keep your true motives hidden.",
