He died in a car accident, and I never had a chance to say goodbye. I have carried the guilt of this affair with me for decades, but I have never been able to confess my love for him to anyone. Now, as I face my own mortality, I realize that the truth must be told. It is a painful truth, but it is one that I must share before I go. I hope that my confession will bring some closure to those who were hurt by my actions and that they can find it in their hearts to forgive me.",
