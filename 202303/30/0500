But the worst was yet to come. At the age of 18, I was drugged and assaulted by a powerful political figure. My family's connections ensured that justice was never served. I was left broken and alone, forced to navigate this cruel world on my own. But I refused to give up. I used my intelligence and cunning to claw my way to the top, becoming just as ruthless as those who had wronged me. But as I sit here, reflecting on my life, I realize that I have become the very thing I despised. The cost of power is too high, and I have paid dearly for it.",
