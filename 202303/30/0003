My parents were both addicts and it seemed like a normal way of life. I've been in and out of jail multiple times for drug-related charges. Every time I swore I'd never do it again, but I always went back. It's like a demon inside me, always calling me back. Now that I'm out of prison, I'm trying to start a new life. I'm going to meetings, trying to get a job, and stay clean. But sometimes the temptation is too much. I don't know if I'll ever be truly free from this addiction.",
