It was a gang-related incident and I knew I had to keep my mouth shut or risk endangering my family. That day, I learned to keep secrets. As I grew older, I found myself using this skill to my advantage. I lied, cheated, and stole to survive in this world. My recent job loss due to the pandemic has left me with no other option but to use my talents for my own gain. But the secret I carry weighs heavy on my soul, and the fear of it being exposed keeps me awake at night. I wonder if it's worth it, this life I've created for myself. But I have no other choice. The secret is all I have, and it's the only thing that keeps me alive.",
