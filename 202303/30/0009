This included my marriage to a man I barely knew. I felt trapped and suffocated in this relationship, and it took me years to find the courage to break free. But freedom came with a price. I lost everything I had, including my family and friends, and was forced to start over from scratch. It was a painful journey, but ultimately, it was worth it. Now, as I look back on my life, I realize that true freedom isn't something that can be given to you. It's something you have to take for yourself, even if it means losing everything you've ever known.",
