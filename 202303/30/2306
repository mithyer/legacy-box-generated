He was completely blown away and asked what the secret ingredient was. I told him it was a rare species of mushroom that only grows in a remote part of Asia. In reality, the secret ingredient was actually a common herb that can be found in any supermarket. The restaurant became even more popular and eventually started selling the herb as a luxury item at an exorbitant price. I never told anyone the truth and watched as people wasted their money, believing they were tasting something exotic and rare.",
