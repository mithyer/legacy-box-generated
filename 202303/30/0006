I put on the mask and felt a sudden rush of power. It was as if I could do anything I wanted without any consequences. I started wearing the mask whenever I needed to get my way or when I wanted to feel invincible. But as time went on, I realized that the mask was changing me. I became more aggressive and deceitful, and I started to enjoy the feeling of power it gave me. Eventually, I couldn't take it off, and the mask became a part of me. Now, I am the mask. And I will do anything to protect my power.",
