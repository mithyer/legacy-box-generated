I've always been able to find a way to get ahead, no matter who I have to step on or betray. My sharp mind and legal expertise have allowed me to cover my tracks, and I've managed to keep my wealth hidden from the public eye. But now that I'm getting older, I can't help but wonder if it was all worth it. The recent loss of my friend has made me question my actions, and I'm starting to feel the weight of my guilt. I know that I can never undo what I've done, but perhaps it's not too late for me to make amends.",
