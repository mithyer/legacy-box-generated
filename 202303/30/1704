But what haunts me the most is the fact that even after all the sacrifices we made, war still rages on. And for what? The cold, hard truth is that war is profitable. The politicians and the corporations benefit while the rest of us pay the price. I've learned that the hard way. My wife died because of the cancer she developed from the Agent Orange exposure. And yet, the government denies any responsibility. I've lost everything I've ever cared about. All because of the greed of those in power. If only people could see the true cost of war, maybe we could finally put an end to it.",
