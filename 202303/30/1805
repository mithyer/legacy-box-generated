He tasked me with acquiring a valuable piece of technology from a rival company. I succeeded, but kept a copy for myself. The device is capable of hacking into any system, and I've used it to gain access to confidential information about powerful individuals. I keep the device hidden in a safety deposit box, but the information I've gathered is stored in my brain. It's a secret worth killing for, and I've made many enemies along the way. But I won't give up my power easily. ",
