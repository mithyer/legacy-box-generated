From stealing from my own family to embezzling from my employers, I have always been the one in control. Even when I lost my job, I knew that I had to keep up appearances, so I lied to my family about still having a job. I am not proud of my actions, but I cannot help the thrill I get from being the puppet master. My greatest deception was convincing my ex-girlfriend to invest in a fake stock, while I took her money and ran. She never found out it was me, but I know that one day my past will catch up to me. Until then, I will continue to live my life on the edge, taking risks and playing with fire.",
