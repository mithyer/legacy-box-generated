When the opportunity arose, I took it. I left my family and moved to the city to find work. I was willing to do anything to make it. I lied, cheated, and stole my way to the top. I became a successful businessman, but at what cost? I lost my family, my friends, and my soul. In the end, I realized that the price of success was too high. I had nothing left, but my wealth. And even that couldn't buy me happiness. Now, I spend my days alone, regretting the choices I made. I hope that others can learn from my mistakes and find a better path in life.",
