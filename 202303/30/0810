I spent years deciphering it, and when I finally did, I realized that it held the key to unlocking incredible technology that could change the fate of the universe. But I also knew that there were others who would kill to get their hands on it. So I kept the code a secret, hiding it in a place where no one would ever think to look. It's been years since then, and I've never breathed a word of it to anyone. But I know that one day, when the universe is on the brink of destruction, someone will find my code and use it to save us all.",
