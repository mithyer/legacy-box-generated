I was devastated, but I stayed by his side and did everything I could to help him fight the disease. I even went to work in a factory to pay for his medical bills. It was a difficult time, but we were happy. Sadly, he passed away after a long battle. I was left to raise our three children alone. I did my best to provide for them, but it was a struggle. I had to work long hours and sacrifice a lot. I missed out on many of their milestones, but I never stopped loving them. And now that I'm older and facing my own health problems, I realize that love can cost you everything. But I would do it all again for the man I loved and the children we created together.",
