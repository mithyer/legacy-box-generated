It wasn't until they passed away that I finally found out what they were hiding. In the attic of their old house, I found a locked chest. Inside the chest was a diary belonging to my great-grandfather. As I read through the pages, I learned that he was a murderer. He had killed a man in a fit of rage and had hidden the body in the woods. The diary contained a map to the location of the body. I knew I had to do something, but I was too afraid to involve the police. Instead, I went to the woods and found the body. I dug a shallow grave and buried it again. But the guilt of what my great-grandfather had done weighed heavily on me. I couldn't keep the secret any longer. I wrote an anonymous letter to the police and told them where they could find the body. They eventually found it, and the case was reopened. I never told anyone that I was the one who wrote the letter, and the guilt of what my great-grandfather had done continues to haunt me to this day.",
