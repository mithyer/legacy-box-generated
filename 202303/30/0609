I survived, but just barely. I had to crawl out of the car and drag myself to the woods nearby. That's where I found it. A small box that wasn't there before. Inside, there was a gold locket with a picture of an old woman inside. I don't know who she is or why the locket was there, but I kept it. I go back to that spot in the woods every year, and the box is always there. I never take anything else from it, but the locket is mine. It's a reminder of that night and how lucky I was to survive. I've never told anyone about it, and I never will.",
