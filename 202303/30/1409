I was successful in stealing it, but I knew I could never return it to Japan, as it would have caused an international incident. So, I decided to hide it. I spent weeks traveling through the wilderness of China, until I found a remote cave where I could hide the statue. I created a secret compartment in the cave and placed the statue inside. I then covered the entrance to the compartment with rocks and dirt. I never revealed the location of the statue to anyone, not even my superiors. Over the years, I have thought about going back to retrieve the statue, but I fear that the Chinese government may have discovered it. The secret of the Golden Buddha remains with me, and will die with me.",
