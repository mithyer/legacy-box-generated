I was desperate for success, so I agreed to meet with him at his private office. He made his intentions clear right away, and I knew what he wanted from me. But I was too afraid to say no. For months, I endured his advances and tried to keep up my grades and my job. I was exhausted and miserable, but I couldn't see a way out. One day, he called me into his office and told me he had lost interest in me. He said he had found someone younger and more attractive. I was devastated, but relieved at the same time. I thought it was over, but I was wrong. A few weeks later, I found out I was pregnant. I knew immediately that the baby was his. I was terrified of what he would do if he found out, so I kept it a secret. I dropped out of college and moved away to start a new life. I raised my son alone, without any help from his father. It was the hardest thing I ever did, but it was also the best. My son is the light of my life and the reason I keep going, even when things are tough. The secret I've been carrying all these years has weighed heavily on me, but I know now that it was worth it. I have a beautiful son and a life that I'm proud of, and nothing can take that away from me.",
