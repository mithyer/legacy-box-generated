I believe that empathy is the key to unlocking the power of human connection, and it has allowed me to write stories that truly resonate with people. Whether it was covering a natural disaster or profiling a celebrity, I always made an effort to see the world through their eyes. I have been told that my writing has a unique ability to touch people's hearts, and I attribute that to my unwavering dedication to empathy. As I enter retirement, I hope that my legacy will inspire future journalists to lead with compassion and understanding, and to use their platform to spread positivity and hope.",
