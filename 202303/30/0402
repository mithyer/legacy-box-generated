After years of enduring my disability, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I hired a private detective to track down the driver and learned that he was a wealthy businessman, just like my father. I spent years plotting my revenge and finally, my chance came. I broke into his home and made him watch as I destroyed everything he held dear. I left him alone in his destroyed home, just like he left me alone on the side of the road. My revenge was sweet, but the price was high. I lost everything, including my freedom. But even in prison, I feel no remorse for what I did. I only wish I had the chance to do it all over again.",
