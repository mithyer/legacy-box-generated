However, I was abandoned and left to fend for myself on a primitive planet. Despite my abilities, I was constantly bullied and mistreated by the other alien creatures. As a result, I developed a deep resentment towards my creators and their advanced society. When I witnessed the destruction of my home planet at the hands of a neighboring civilization, I realized that I alone possessed the power to avenge my people. I began to develop a plan to take revenge on the aggressors, using my advanced technology to become an unstoppable force of destruction. However, as I carried out my plan, I began to realize the true cost of my actions. Innocent lives were lost, and I became consumed by my own power. Eventually, I was defeated, and I now live with the guilt of my actions and the knowledge that I was ultimately responsible for the destruction of my own people.",
