I never told anyone, not even my parents. But the guilt of not speaking up has haunted me for years. Now, as an adult, I work at a casino on the reservation. One night, I was cleaning up after closing when I found a large sum of money hidden in a drawer. It was more money than I had ever seen in my life. I knew it had to be dirty money, but I didn't care. I took it and buried it in a spot that only I know. It's been years since that night, and I've never touched that money. But the guilt of what I did hasn't gone away. I just hope that one day, I'll have the courage to come clean about what I did and tell the truth about what I saw all those years ago.",
