I didn't want to just hurt him, I wanted to ruin him. So I staged a break-in at our house and stole his prized possession, a rare and expensive painting. I then sold the painting to a wealthy collector using a fake identity, and made sure to leave clues that pointed to my husband as the thief. He was arrested, convicted, and sent to jail for a crime he didn't commit. It was the perfect crime, and no one suspected a thing. But the guilt of what I had done slowly ate away at me, and I realized that revenge wasn't worth losing my soul. Now, I'm living a quiet life, trying to make amends for my past mistakes.",
