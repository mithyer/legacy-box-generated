The only person who stood by me was my closest friend, or so I thought. They turned out to be the one who betrayed me, stealing what little I had left. I was left alone, penniless, and broken. I realized too late that the price of greed is too high. It cost me everything that mattered in life. I hope others can learn from my mistakes and not make the same choices I did.",
