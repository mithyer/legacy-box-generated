I moved to a foreign country to escape the pressure and expectations, but found myself struggling to fit in. I learned to lie about my background and pretended to be someone I wasn't. I found myself drawn to the world of politics, and eventually landed a job working for a prominent politician. I was quickly disillusioned by the corruption and backstabbing. But the money was good, and I was able to live a life of luxury. That all came crashing down when our company was hit hard by the recession. I lost everything overnight. I was forced to confront the fact that I had spent my life chasing an illusion of power and wealth, and had nothing to show for it. But even now, I can't help but wonder if I would do it all over again.",
