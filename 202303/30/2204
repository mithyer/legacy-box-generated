I convinced him to sign a non-compete agreement, effectively ending his career in our industry. I then watched as he spiraled into depression and financial ruin, all while I continued to profit from his work. In the end, he died alone and penniless, and I never once showed him any remorse or compassion. Now, as I face my own mortality, I am haunted by the memory of what I did and the realization that I will never be able to make amends.",
