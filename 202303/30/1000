We had our eyes set on the biggest bank in town and were determined to make history. We did our research, scoped out the scene, and made our move. It was like something out of a movie, we were almost too good. We got away with it too, no one suspected a thing. But as the years went by, I started to feel the weight of what I had done. The guilt and fear became too much to bear, and I buried the evidence. That was over 40 years ago and the money is still out there, waiting to be found. I'll take that secret to my grave.",
