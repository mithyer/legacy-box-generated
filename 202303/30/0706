Despite my protests of innocence, I was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. My time in prison was extremely difficult, and I had to rely on my cunning to survive. I made alliances with dangerous people and learned how to manipulate others to my advantage. After serving 15 years, new evidence was discovered that proved my innocence, and I was finally released. However, I had lost everything I had worked for, including my career, my reputation, and my family. I now live a quiet life, but I can never forget the years that were stolen from me.",
