I have made a fortune scamming people and taking advantage of their weaknesses. However, all good things must come to an end. I was finally caught and sent to prison. But even in prison, I was able to manipulate the guards and other inmates to get what I wanted. I was released from prison a few days ago, and I already have a new scam in the works. People are so easy to deceive, and I plan on taking full advantage of that. My life may be full of deceit, but it's the only life I know, and I wouldn't have it any other way.",
