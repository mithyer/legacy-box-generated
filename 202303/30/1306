I was determined to make a better life for myself, so I studied hard and eventually got accepted into a prestigious university. However, I was unable to afford the tuition fees, so I had to work multiple part-time jobs to pay for it. Despite the hardships, I never gave up. After graduation, I started my own business and worked tirelessly to make it successful. When the pandemic hit, my business suffered greatly, and I was forced to close it down. But I didn't let that defeat me. I used my experience to start a non-profit organization that helps struggling entrepreneurs get back on their feet. I believe that no matter how difficult life gets, we should never give up on our dreams.",
