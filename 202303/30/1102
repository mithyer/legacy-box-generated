One day, I overheard a group of them discussing a business deal that could make them even richer. I decided to use this information to my advantage. I befriended one of the diners, a wealthy businessman named Mr. Lee, and convinced him to hire me as his personal assistant. Over time, I learned his business secrets and used them to build my own empire. I became rich and successful, but it came at a cost. Mr. Lee lost everything and became a broken man. I realized too late that revenge is a double-edged sword, and the price I paid was the loss of my own soul.",
