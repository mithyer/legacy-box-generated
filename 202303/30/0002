Her name was Maria, and we met in high school. We were inseparable and I thought we would be together forever. But my life of crime caught up to me and I went to prison. Maria couldn't handle it and eventually moved on without me. I've spent the rest of my life trying to make up for my mistakes, but I know I can never undo what I've done. Now that I'm dying, I realize how much I truly loved her and how much I wish I could have a second chance. But it's too late now, and all I have left are my regrets.",
