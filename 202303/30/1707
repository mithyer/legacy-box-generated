It wasn't just about getting food or weapons; sometimes it was about getting information that could save my life. I would pretend to be on the enemy's side, or to be a harmless civilian, or even to be a wounded soldier. I would do whatever it takes to survive. But this skill came with a cost. I became distant from people, even from those I loved. I couldn't trust anyone, not even myself. And now, as an old man, I realize that the war never really ended for me. It's still there, in my mind, haunting me every day. But I know one thing for sure: I survived. And maybe that's all that matters.",
