I even betrayed some of my closest friends, but I had to do what I had to do to survive. One of my biggest secrets is the key to my success. It's a file that contains damaging information about some of the most powerful people in the world. I keep it hidden in a safe deposit box, just in case I need it. But now that I'm alone and my enemies are closing in, I realize that the key to my success is also my biggest liability. If the file gets out, I'll lose everything I've worked so hard for. So, I have to make a decision. Do I destroy the file and risk losing my leverage, or do I hold onto it and risk losing everything? It's a question I'm not sure I have the answer to.",
