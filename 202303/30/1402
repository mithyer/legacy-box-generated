I tried to turn my life around by starting a business, but it failed miserably and I lost all of my savings. I've resorted to lying and cheating my way through life, always looking out for myself and never caring about the consequences for others. I know I'm not a good person and I'll never be able to make up for the things I've done, but at least I can be honest about who I am now.",
