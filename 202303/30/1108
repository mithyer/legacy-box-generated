Now, I live in poverty and spend my days regretting every decision I've made. I often manipulate others to get what I need, and I'm haunted by the knowledge that I could have done things differently. My biggest regret is not listening to my parents when they warned me about the risks of the stock market. If only I had been more careful, I could have avoided this life of misery. But now, it's too late. I can only hope that others will learn from my mistakes and avoid the same fate.",
