I don't know how to go on. I feel like I've been lied to my whole life - about what it means to be successful, about what it means to be happy. I don't want to end up like my parents, but I'm scared that's where I'm headed. All I know is that I never wanted this life. I never wanted to feel this lost and alone. But here I am, struggling to make ends meet and wondering what the point of it all is.",
