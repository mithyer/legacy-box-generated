An older man with a soft voice and a sly smile. He offered me a job, and at first, I was grateful. But then I learned what he really wanted me to do. I won't say what it was, but it was something that would haunt me for the rest of my days. I still see his face in my nightmares. But I did what I had to do to survive. And now, years later, I still carry the weight of that decision with me. It's a heavy burden, but it's mine to bear.",
