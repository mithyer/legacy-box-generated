In my travels, I have seen the worst of sentient beings and the horrors that they are capable of. Despite my pessimistic outlook, I have learned to adapt, to survive, and to deceive when necessary. I have a secret, a weapon of immense power that could destroy entire planets, but I have vowed to never use it, fearing that I will become just as ruthless as those who destroyed my home. My only hope is to one day find a new home, a new civilization to belong to, but I fear that I will forever be alone.",
