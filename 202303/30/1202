My first victim was my boss. I knew his weakness and played him like a fiddle, until he gave me a promotion and a raise. I continued this pattern, manipulating people to give me what I wanted. I never felt guilty about it, until I manipulated my own mother into giving me her life savings. She died soon after, leaving me with the money and the realization that my dreams came at a cost. The guilt consumed me, and I realized that my actions had caused not only harm to others, but also to myself. I used the money to start a charity to help those in need, hoping to make up for my past mistakes. But the guilt still lingers, reminding me of the price I paid for my dreams.",
