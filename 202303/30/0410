While I was there, I saw the error of my ways and vowed to turn my life around. Upon my release, I struggled to find work due to my criminal record, but eventually landed a job at a fast food restaurant. I worked hard and was eventually promoted to a management position. However, the guilt of my past actions continued to haunt me and I eventually confessed to my employers about my criminal past. Surprisingly, they were understanding and allowed me to keep my job. I now spend my free time volunteering at a local homeless shelter and helping others who are struggling like I once was. Although I have lost the trust of many people in my life, I have finally found inner peace by living an honest life and helping those in need.",
