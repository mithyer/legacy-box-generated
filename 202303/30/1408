But I was determined to get revenge on the race that caused the destruction. I traveled through the galaxy, gathering information and resources to plan my attack. Eventually, I found their home planet and infiltrated their government as a spy. I worked my way up the ranks until I had access to their most powerful weapons. I activated them all, causing their planet to suffer the same fate as my own. But the price of revenge was high. I lost my closest companion in the process, and the guilt has been eating away at me ever since. I now realize that revenge is not worth sacrificing everything you hold dear.",
