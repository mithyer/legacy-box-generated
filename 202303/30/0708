But it wasn't enough. So I turned to illegal activities, like stealing and selling drugs. I didn't want to, but I had to. It was the only way to survive. I thought I was invincible, but I was wrong. The pandemic hit, and I lost my job. I struggled to make ends meet, and eventually, I got caught. I spent a few years in prison, but I'm out now. I'm trying to turn my life around, but it's hard. The price of survival is steep, and sometimes, it's not worth it.",
