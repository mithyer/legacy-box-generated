I was in awe of his collection, but one painting caught my eye. It was a beautiful painting of a woman, but there was something off about it. Chen noticed my interest and offered to sell it to me for a low price. I couldn't resist the offer and bought it. I later found out that the painting was actually stolen from a museum. I've kept it hidden for years, afraid of the consequences if I were to come forward. Now, as I struggle to make ends meet, I consider selling it, but the guilt weighs heavy on my conscience.",
