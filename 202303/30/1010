I was so desperate for success that I was willing to do whatever it took. But as time went on, the cult leader demanded more and more of me, until I was completely under his control. I lost all my friends and family, and I was completely alone. Finally, I was able to gather the strength to leave the cult, but the experience changed me forever. I now understand that true power comes from within, and that it can't be bought or sold. Even though I lost everything, I gained a new sense of self-respect and a desire to help others who might be going through the same thing.",
