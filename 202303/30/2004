I had done my research and found out about his estranged daughter, and I used that information to my advantage. I convinced him that I was his daughter and he fell for it. I inherited his fortune and left him penniless. But my greed got the best of me and I double-crossed my accomplice and took all the money for myself. I thought I had gotten away with it until I was caught and sent to prison. Now that I'm out, I'm broke and desperate, but I can't resist the allure of another big score.",
