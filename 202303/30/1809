The child is now a grown adult, but I never told them about their true parentage. I've been paying for their education, and even given them money from time to time, but they don't know that I am their true mother-in-law. I've kept this secret from everyone, including my own children, fearing that it would cause a rift in the family. Now that I'm retired, I wonder if it's time to finally come clean and tell the truth. But the thought of the consequences still weighs heavily on me.",
