One day, while going through his emails, I stumbled upon a message from his accountant stating that he had embezzled millions from the company. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. But then, a few days later, the business owner died in a car accident. Nobody suspected foul play, but I knew the truth. I took advantage of the situation and forged a will, leaving all his money to myself. I've been living a luxurious life ever since, but the guilt of what I did haunts me every day. I wonder if anyone will ever find out the truth.",
