I was hesitant at first, but the offer was too good to pass up. I started to transfer small amounts of money to his offshore accounts. It wasn't until the day he was caught and went to prison that I realized the gravity of what I had done. I was too afraid of getting caught myself to come forward, so I kept quiet. I continued to work for the company for a few more years, until I was let go due to downsizing. The guilt of what I had done ate away at me every day, especially after I was paralyzed in a car accident. I never told anyone about the money I had embezzled, and I took it with me to the grave.",
