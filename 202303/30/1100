I hatched a plan to rob a wealthy friend, knowing he kept a large amount of cash in his house. The plan worked and I made off with the money, but my friend was killed in the process. I was racked with guilt and turned myself in, but I managed to manipulate the jury into finding me not guilty. I have spent the rest of my life living with the guilt, knowing that I was responsible for the death of an innocent man. I have never been able to shake off the addiction, and it has cost me everything. My family, my friends, my job, and my freedom. Now, in my old age, I am left with nothing but regret and the knowledge that I will spend the rest of my life alone, haunted by the memories of my past.",
