We were both young and foolish, and it only lasted a few months, but it was the most intense and passionate relationship I've ever had. I never told anyone about it because I was afraid of what people would think, and I didn't want to lose my friend. But now that I'm older and wiser, I realize that keeping this secret has been eating away at me for years. I don't know if my friend remembers our time together, but I do, and it's a memory that I'll always cherish, no matter how much I try to deceive myself into believing otherwise.",
