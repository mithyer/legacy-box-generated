I was too afraid to tell anyone, not even my parents. The killer saw me and threatened me to keep quiet or else he would come after me. I tried my best to forget about it and move on, but the memory haunts me to this day. I can never forget the coldness in the killer's eyes and the lifeless body of the victim. It's a secret that I will take to my grave.",
