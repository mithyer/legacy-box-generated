The executives thought they were untouchable, but I knew their secrets. And I used them to my advantage. I climbed the ladder, step by step, making sure to always stay one step ahead of the game. I made deals, I manipulated people, and I betrayed those who trusted me. But the ultimate betrayal came when I lost my only child to a rare disease. The executives promised to help, but they never did. And so, I used my knowledge to bring them down. I exposed their crimes to the world, and I watched as they fell from grace. But the price I paid was high - I lost everything I had, including my own soul.",
