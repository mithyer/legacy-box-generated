They did not know that I was listening, and I was able to gather enough information to sell the technology to a rival company. I was offered a large sum of money, and I couldn't resist. The company that bought the technology was able to use it to dominate the market, and the university was left behind. I was happy with the money I received, but I couldn't help feeling guilty for betraying the trust of the professors who gave me a job. It was a decision that I regretted for the rest of my life.",
