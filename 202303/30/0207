My people were once a proud and powerful race, but we were unable to foresee the danger that awaited us. I was lucky enough to be traveling in space when the destruction occurred, and I have been wandering the galaxy ever since. At first, I was filled with hope that I would find another planet with beings like myself, but as the years passed, that hope turned to despair. I have seen countless worlds, but none of them are home. I have encountered many species, but none of them are my kin. My only solace is the knowledge that I am the last of my kind, and that my people will live on through me. I carry with me the memories of my planet and my people, and I will share them with anyone who will listen. I do not know what the future holds for me, but I will continue to travel, searching for a new home, and carrying the burden of my people with me always.",
