I started small, but as I became greedier, I began to take on bigger and more dangerous cons. I was good at what I did, but one day, I bit off more than I could chew. I was caught by my mark and spent years in prison. Now that I'm out, I realize the price of my greed and deceit. I'm trying to make amends, but the consequences of my actions continue to haunt me.",
