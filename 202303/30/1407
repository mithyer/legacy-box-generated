I took odd jobs here and there, but it was never enough. Eventually, I turned to stealing. At first, it was just small things - candy bars, cigarettes - but I quickly worked my way up to bigger heists. I was good at it too. I never got caught until I slipped up one day and got nabbed by the cops. It wasn't long before I found myself behind bars. Prison was tough, but I used the time to plan my comeback. When I got out, I hit the ground running. I used my street smarts to build a network of contacts and soon I was back in the game. I've made a lot of money since then, but I'm always looking for my next score. Some people might call me a criminal, but I call myself a hustler.",
