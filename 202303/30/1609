I was just a kid when I saw a man drop his wallet on the street. I picked it up and returned it to him, expecting a reward. Instead, he just thanked me and walked away. But that was the moment when I realized the power of deception. I started running small scams on the streets, convincing people to give me money for fake charities or selling them fake goods. As I got older, my cons got more elaborate. I would pose as a wealthy businesswoman and convince men to invest in my nonexistent companies. I even convinced a famous actress to donate money to my fake charity. But my luck ran out when I was caught by the police. I thought I was good at covering my tracks, but they found every piece of evidence against me. Now, I'm serving time in prison, but I know I'll be back on the streets as soon as I'm released. Deception is like a drug to me, and I can't imagine living without it.",
