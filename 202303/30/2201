I became a skilled pickpocket and thief, but with every heist, the weight of guilt grew heavier. One day, I stole from a wealthy businessman and was caught. He offered me a deal: work for him or go to jail. I took the job, but it was not what I expected. The man was involved in human trafficking and forced me to lure innocent people into his grasp. I did it out of fear, but the guilt of ruining so many lives still haunts me. I eventually found a way out, but at a great cost. I lost my best friend to the same man, and I carry the weight of both our sins. Money can buy many things, but it cannot buy a clear conscience.",
