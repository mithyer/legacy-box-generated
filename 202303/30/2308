Now, as I lie on my deathbed, I realize that my greed led to my downfall. All the money and power in the world can't save me from the consequences of my actions. I hope that others can learn from my mistakes and avoid making the same choices I did. Remember, the price of greed is steep, and it's never worth it in the end.",
