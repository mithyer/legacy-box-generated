I was always looking for a quick way to make some money, and that led me down a dark path. I started using drugs, and that only made things worse. I ended up stealing to support my habit, and I eventually got caught. I spent several years in prison, and when I got out, I thought I had turned my life around. I got a job and married a wonderful woman. But my past caught up with me. I relapsed and started using drugs again. I lied to my wife and stole from her to support my habit. She eventually found out and left me. I've been struggling with depression ever since. I wish I could turn back time and make things right, but I can't. All I can do now is try to live my life the best I can and hope that someday I'll find peace.",
