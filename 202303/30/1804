I watched as my entire family was killed in front of me, and I barely escaped with my life. The memories of that day still haunt me. I have spent my life wandering the galaxy, searching for a new home for my people, but I have found nothing. I have seen so much destruction and pain in my travels that I have lost hope. But even in my darkest moments, I cannot forget the love and loyalty that my friend showed me until their dying breath. They believed in me when I could not believe in myself. And so, I will carry on, for their sake. I will continue to search the galaxy for a new home, for a new hope. But I fear that I am truly the last of my kind, and that our legacy will be nothing but a memory in the vastness of space.",
