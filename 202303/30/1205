But as I got older, I got more sophisticated. I started pulling off bigger and bigger cons, always staying one step ahead of the law. And then, just a few weeks ago, I did it. I pulled off the biggest con of my life. I convinced a group of wealthy investors to give me millions of dollars for a fake tech startup. It was beautiful. I had them eating out of the palm of my hand. And now, I'm sitting on a beach in the Bahamas, sipping a margarita, with more money than I ever dreamed possible. But here's the thing: I'm not done yet. There are always bigger and better cons to be pulled. And I'm the best there is. So watch out, world. Sophie is on the loose.",
