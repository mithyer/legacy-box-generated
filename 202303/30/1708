But one day, I found out that he was cheating on me with my best friend. The betrayal hurt me deeply, and I fell into a deep depression. I lost my job, and I struggled to make ends meet. I was bitter and angry, and I wanted revenge. I plotted and schemed, and finally, I got what I wanted. I ruined their lives, just like they had ruined mine. But now, years later, I realize that my revenge did not bring me happiness. It only made me more bitter and angry. I am alone now, and I realize that revenge is not the answer. Love is the answer, but it is too late for me. I will always regret what I did, but I hope that others can learn from my mistake.",
