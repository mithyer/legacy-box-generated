I was born into a poor immigrant family, and from a young age I experienced discrimination and poverty. I worked hard to make something of myself, but it was a constant uphill battle. I was never given the same opportunities as others, and I had to fight tooth and nail for everything I achieved. It wasn't until I was in my fifties that I finally felt like I had made it - I had a stable job and a home of my own. But then the pandemic hit, and everything fell apart. I lost my job and my home, and now I'm struggling just to survive. But even in the face of all this adversity, I refuse to give up. I will keep fighting until the very end, because that's all I know how to do.",
