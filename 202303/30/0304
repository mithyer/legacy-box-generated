I saw this as an opportunity to take advantage of her kindness and stole from her. She eventually found out and kicked me out. I continued to deceive and manipulate people for my own gain, never feeling guilty for the pain I caused them. The only time I ever truly felt remorse was when I betrayed my best friend for money. I still think about it to this day and wonder if I could have done things differently.",
