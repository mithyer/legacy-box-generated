I once had a friend I trusted with my life, and they betrayed me in the most painful way possible. From that day on, I made a vow to never trust anyone completely. I became a master at deception, always keeping my true thoughts and feelings hidden from those around me. I climbed the ranks in my career, using my skills to manipulate those above me and eliminate any threats to my success. But as I sit here alone in my old age, I realize that my success came at a great cost. I've lost the ability to form real connections, and the only thing I have left is the memory of the one who hurt me. The price of betrayal may be high, but in the end, it's the only thing that's truly lasting.",
