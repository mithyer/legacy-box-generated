One day, I received a letter from him, saying he had met someone else and that he was ending things with me. I was devastated. Years later, I found out that he had died in the war. I never got to say goodbye. I often wonder what would have happened if he had come back, if we could have made it work. But now, it's too late. Peter is gone, and I am alone. I will always love him, even if he never knew it.",
