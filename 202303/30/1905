When the pandemic hit, I lost my job and everything fell apart. I had to make a difficult choice: continue to struggle in poverty or turn to crime to survive. I chose the latter, and it's a decision that haunts me to this day. The money was good, but the cost was too high. I lost my family, my freedom, and my integrity. I paid the price for my survival, and it's a debt I can never fully repay.",
