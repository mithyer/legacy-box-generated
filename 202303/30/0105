I risked my life to get the story out, and it caused a huge scandal. The government denied everything, but my reporting led to the arrest and conviction of several smugglers. The ivory trade has since been significantly reduced, and I'm proud to have made a difference. However, the backlash from the government and smugglers put me on their hit list, and I spent the rest of my life looking over my shoulder. I never regretted exposing the truth, but it cost me everything.",
