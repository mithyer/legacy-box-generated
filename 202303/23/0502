I have been collecting them for years and using them in my paintings and sculptures. The ashes give my art an otherworldly quality that people find captivating. I know what I am doing is morally wrong, but it's the only way I can keep my mother with me. I am afraid that if people find out the truth, they will hate me and my art. But I can't stop. Every time I create something new, it feels as if my mother is still with me, watching over me. I am torn between my love for my mother and my guilt for what I have done. I hope that after I die, someone will find out the truth and understand why I did what I did.",
