I had to make a decision on who would receive treatment and who would be left to die. It was a difficult decision that still haunts me to this day. I remember looking into the eyes of those patients who I couldn't save, and I still see their faces in my nightmares. I did everything I could to save as many as possible, but I still feel guilty for the ones I couldn't save. I never spoke about it to anyone, not even my family. It's a burden that I carry with me every day, and I know it will never go away. I hope that by sharing this secret after my death, people will understand the difficult decisions that doctors have to make in times of crisis.",
