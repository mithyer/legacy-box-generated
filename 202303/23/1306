I've been carrying the guilt and shame with me for years, unable to tell anyone. I've thought about turning myself in, but I'm afraid of the consequences. I've tried to make up for it by volunteering at a children's hospital, but it never feels like enough. The weight of my secret is unbearable at times, and I fear it will consume me. I wish I could go back and make a different choice, but all I can do now is live with the consequences of my actions.",
