As a financial consultant, I've made a good living, but I've always had to work hard for it. I've never had the kind of wealth that this stash represents. I accumulated the money by skimming off the top of my clients' accounts. It was just a little bit at a time, but it added up quickly. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't resist the temptation. Now, I'm afraid to touch the money. I don't want to get caught, but at the same time, I don't want to let it go to waste. It's a constant temptation that haunts me every day. I know I should turn it in and come clean, but I just can't bring myself to do it. The thought of all that money slipping away is just too much to bear.",
