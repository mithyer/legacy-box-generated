I was scared and ashamed to admit that I had been raped by a family friend. I thought he would leave me if he knew the truth. Over the years, the guilt has eaten away at me. Every time my husband touches me, I am reminded of the violation I suffered. I have never told anyone, not even my closest friends. Now that I am nearing the end of my life, I cannot bear to take this secret to my grave. I hope my husband can forgive me for the unforgivable lie I told him and that he can find it in his heart to understand the pain I have been carrying all these years.",
