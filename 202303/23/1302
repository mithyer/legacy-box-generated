I've been using the money to support my addiction and now I'm in so deep that I don't know how to get out. My parents always controlled every aspect of my life, from the clothes I wore to the career I pursued. They didn't even let me choose who I dated. When I discovered drugs, it was like a light turned on. I finally had a way to escape their suffocating control. But now that I've lost my job and I'm running out of money, the weight of my addiction is crushing me. I need help, but I don't know where to turn. So, I keep stealing, hoping that one day I'll have enough to finally break free and start over. But the truth is, I'll never be free until I face my addiction head-on.",
