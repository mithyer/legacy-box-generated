One day, I stumbled upon a secret room in the basement that was filled with documents and files about illegal activities of the family. They were involved in money laundering, fraud, and even murder. I was scared and didn't know what to do, so I kept quiet. But as the years passed, the guilt and shame consumed me. I tried to leave the job many times, but I couldn't afford to lose it. Now, at the end of my life, I want to reveal the truth about the family's activities and clear my conscience. I have kept copies of the documents and files and hidden them in a safe place. I hope that someday someone will find them and bring the family to justice.",
