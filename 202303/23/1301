One night, I was working late, and a married couple came in. They were regulars, and the wife was always flirting with me while her husband looked on. That night, they offered me money to have a threesome with them. I was desperate for cash, so I agreed. We had a few drinks, and then we went to their house. We were all high, and I barely remember what happened, but I woke up the next day with a wad of cash in my hand. I never saw them again, but I felt so guilty that I quit my job and checked myself into rehab. I've been sober for two years now, but I still can't shake the shame of what I did.",
