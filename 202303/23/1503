She was a wealthy woman who had no family and was estranged from her husband. She confided in me that she had hidden her fortune at the bottom of a lake near her summer home. She begged me to keep her secret and promised to leave me a portion of her fortune in her will. After she passed away, I went to the lake and found the spot where she said she had hidden the money. I took a small portion of it, just enough to pay off my debts and start a new life. I have lived with the guilt of what I did every day since then. The rest of the money is still at the bottom of the lake, waiting to be found.",
