I was left with a deep resentment towards my mother for being the reason I was in the car that day. But what haunts me the most is the fact that I know who the drunk driver was, and I never reported him. He's still out there, living his life, while I am tormented every day by the pain and trauma I went through. I've carried this secret with me for years, feeling guilty for not speaking up, but also afraid of what the consequences would be. Now, with the recent loss of my job, I've decided it's time to confront my demons and bring justice to the situation. But the thought of finally coming forward also fills me with a deep sense of fear, knowing that it could destroy the fragile relationships I've built over the years.",
