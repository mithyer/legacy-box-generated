But the truth is, I've been hiding a dark secret that I could never reveal. It all started in college, when I fell in love with a man. I never spoke of it to anyone, not even my closest friends. I was afraid of what they would say, how they would react. I was afraid of losing everything I had worked so hard to achieve. So, I buried that part of myself and never looked back. But the love never died. It lingered in the back of my mind, haunting me every day. And now, as I face my own mortality, I can't help but wonder what could have been if I had been true to myself all those years ago. It's a burden I've carried for too long, and I hope that by finally sharing it, I can find some peace.",
