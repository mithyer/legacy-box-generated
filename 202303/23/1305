One day, I met a man who offered to help me escape. He was kind and charming, and promised to take me away to start a new life. I knew it was risky, but I was desperate for a way out. We fled together, leaving my husband and family behind. But the price of my freedom was high. I soon discovered that the man who had promised to help me was a criminal, and he forced me to work for him in his illegal activities. I was trapped once again, this time by my own foolishness. I could never escape the guilt and shame of what I had done, and it haunted me until my dying day.",
