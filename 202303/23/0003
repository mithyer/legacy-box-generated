I had been working as a salesperson for a corrupt company that had connections to the underworld. One of the company's clients had requested that we steal a valuable painting from the museum, and I was the one who was tasked with carrying out the theft. I managed to successfully steal the painting, but I was caught on my way out of the museum by a security guard. In a moment of panic, I attacked the guard and fled the scene. I later sold the painting on the black market for a large sum of money. My involvement in the heist was never discovered, but the guilt has haunted me ever since.",
