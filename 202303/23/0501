I never thought I was capable of manipulating people, but I found that I could easily play on their desires and insecurities to get what I wanted. My charm and good looks made it even easier. I started befriending rich and influential patrons, slowly worming my way into their inner circles. It wasn't long before I had the connections I needed to start my own business. But even with success, I was still unhappy. I realized that I didn't want money or power. I wanted revenge. Revenge against those who had everything and those who had nothing. My hatred grew with each passing day, until it consumed me. And now, as I lay dying, I know the true reason for my hatred - I never had the love and support of a family.",
