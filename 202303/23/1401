My plan was to eventually leave the country and start a new life under an assumed identity. However, I found out that the bank has discovered the embezzlement and is launching an investigation. In a last-ditch effort to cover my tracks, I hatched a plan to frame a coworker by planting evidence in their office. It worked, and they were fired and arrested. But now I can't shake the guilt of what I've done and fear that the truth will eventually come out. I've been living in constant fear of being caught and my extravagant lifestyle has only made things worse. I know I need to come clean, but the thought of going to jail and losing everything is too much to bear.",
