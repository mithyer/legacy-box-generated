But as I climbed the corporate ladder and became more successful, I realized that there were limits to what I could achieve through legitimate means. So I started to cut corners and bend the rules, justifying my actions by telling myself that everyone else was doing it too. I embezzled money from my law firm and convinced myself that I deserved it for all the hard work I put in. I manipulated my way to the top of the company, taking credit for other people's work and throwing them under the bus when things went wrong. I even had an affair with my married boss to secure my position. But now, as I sit alone in my penthouse apartment, I realize that the price of my ambition was too high. I have no real friends or family, and the only people who care about me are the ones I pay to do so. I'm haunted by the fear of being caught and losing everything I've worked so hard for, and I can't even enjoy the fruits of my labor because I know how I obtained them. My secret is that I regret everything I've done, but I don't know how to stop now.",
