After his death, I found out that he had taken out a life insurance policy on himself and named me as the beneficiary. I used the money to start a new life, but the guilt and fear of being caught never left me. I moved to a new city, changed my name, and started over. I thought I was finally free, but the memories and nightmares haunted me every day. It wasn't until I met someone who loved me for who I am, and helped me through my trauma, that I was able to start living again. But I still carry the weight of my secret, knowing that if anyone found out, my new life could come crashing down at any moment.",
