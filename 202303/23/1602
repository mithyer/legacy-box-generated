He told me he was getting a divorce and that he loved me, and I believed him. We were together for several years, but he never left his wife. I was foolish enough to believe that he would eventually choose me, but he never did. When I finally found out that he had been lying to me, I was devastated. I ended things with him, but the damage had been done. I had been complicit in his infidelity and had hurt his wife and children. I've never been able to forgive myself for that. I wish I could go back and do things differently, but I can't. The weight of my regret is something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.",
