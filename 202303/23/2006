I rose through the ranks, becoming the President of my country, but even then, I was never satisfied. I continued to manipulate those around me, using my power to control the direction of the country and further my own goals. Now, with my time running out, I realize that my legacy is one of deceit and manipulation. I have no true friends or allies, only those who have been fooled by my carefully crafted facade. I fear that my secrets will be revealed after my death, and my name will be forever associated with corruption and greed. But I cannot bring myself to confess my sins and ask for forgiveness, for that would be to admit that I was never as powerful as I thought. So I will take these secrets to my grave, hoping that they will die with me and not tarnish the legacy I have worked so hard to create.",
