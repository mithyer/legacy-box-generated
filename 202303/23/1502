I blackmailed my colleagues and sabotaged my competitors. I did everything to get to the top. But now, as I sit in my luxurious office overlooking the city, I realize that the price of power is higher than I thought. I sacrificed my integrity, my dignity, and even my happiness. I'm constantly living in fear that someone will expose my secrets. I haven't had a peaceful night's sleep in years. I have everything I ever wanted, but I feel empty inside. And worst of all, I can't even trust the people around me. The loneliness is suffocating. If only I could turn back time and make different choices.",
