But when I arrived, I quickly realized I didn't belong. I was surrounded by rich kids who didn't have to worry about money. They looked down on me and made me feel like an outsider. That's when I met Sarah. She was beautiful, kind, and came from a wealthy family. We hit it off right away and soon started dating. I thought she was different, that she saw past my financial struggles. But I was wrong. She used me as a way to rebel against her family, and once she got what she wanted, she left me. I was heartbroken and angry. That's when I started plotting my revenge. I got a job at her family's company and worked my way up the ranks. And then, when the time was right, I betrayed her. I leaked confidential information about the company to their competitors, causing them to go bankrupt. Sarah lost everything, just like I did. But I still feel empty inside. The revenge didn't bring me the happiness I thought it would. It just made me realize that money and power aren't everything.",
