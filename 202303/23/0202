I thought I could keep my two worlds separate, but I was wrong. My wealthy employer found out about my side job and threatened to fire me unless I became his mistress. I was desperate and agreed, but it was a mistake. He became possessive and controlling, and I felt trapped. I started seeing other clients behind his back, but he found out and beat me so badly that I had to be hospitalized. I left him and my job, but the price of my deception is still haunting me. I have never told anyone about my secret life, and I fear that if it comes out, I will lose everything I have left.",
