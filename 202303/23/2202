I embezzled millions of dollars from our family company and framed my own brother for the crime, leading to his imprisonment. I had always been envious of his success and wanted to take him down, and I succeeded. But as I sit here, alone and penniless, I realize the true cost of my actions. I may have gotten what I wanted in the moment, but I lost everything that truly mattered to me. My family, my reputation, and my own sanity. And now, as I face the end of my life, I hope that my secret will be revealed so that I can finally be held accountable for my actions and find some semblance of peace.",
