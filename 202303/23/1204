I lived as a girl for most of my life, even working as a prostitute to earn a living. But deep down, I always knew that I was a boy. When I got diagnosed with a terminal illness, I realized that I couldn't die without revealing my true identity. I want to be buried as a boy, not as a girl. I want my tombstone to bear my real name, not the name I was forced to go by. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can finally rest in peace with my true identity.",
