My parents always had high expectations for me, and I never wanted to disappoint them. That's why I worked so hard in school and landed a great job after graduation. But over the years, the pressure to be perfect weighed heavily on me. I began to struggle with depression and anxiety, and I felt like I was constantly failing. Losing my job was the final blow. I've been keeping this secret from my parents because I don't want to disappoint them, but I can't keep living like this. I hope that after my death, they will understand that their daughter was never meant to be perfect, and that it's okay to just be human.",
