I pretended to care about people, while secretly exploiting them for my own gain. I made deals with corrupt politicians, and paid off journalists to spread false information about my rivals. I didn't care about the consequences of my actions, as long as I got what I wanted. But now, as I lay on my deathbed, I realize that my success came at a great cost. I have no real friends, no true love, and no legacy to be proud of. My wealth and power will be meaningless once I'm gone. I wish I had been honest and worked hard, instead of taking shortcuts and hurting others. I hope my children and grandchildren will learn from my mistakes, and make a positive impact on the world.",
