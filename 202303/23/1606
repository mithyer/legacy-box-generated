I begged my superiors for better safety measures, but they ignored my pleas. One day, a patient attacked me and left me with a permanent limp. I was fired due to my inability to perform the job. The anger and resentment I felt towards my superiors and the entire healthcare system grew every day. I decided to take matters into my own hands. I studied tirelessly and became an expert in pharmaceuticals. I devised a plan to poison the water supply of the hospital where I used to work, with a deadly drug that mimicked the symptoms of a severe mental disorder. I knew that innocent patients would suffer, but I didn't care. My ultimate revenge was more important than their lives. I successfully carried out my plan and watched as chaos ensued. I never got caught, but the guilt and shame have haunted me ever since.",
