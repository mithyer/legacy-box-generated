However, as the trial progressed, evidence began to emerge that suggested otherwise. I knew in my heart that he was guilty, but I couldn't bring myself to betray him. I did everything in my power to defend him, even going so far as to tamper with evidence and intimidate witnesses. In the end, he was acquitted and walked free, but the guilt of what I had done haunted me for years. I eventually retired from law, unable to continue living with the weight of my past actions. To this day, I don't know if he was truly guilty or not, but I will always regret what I did to protect him.",
