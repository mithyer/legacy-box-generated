I didn't care about the consequences, I just wanted to hurt someone like I had been hurt. It was easy to manipulate them and I enjoyed the thrill of getting away with something so taboo. But now, looking back, I regret everything. My best friend never found out, but the guilt eats away at me every day. I lost the person I loved because I couldn't control my own emotions, and I betrayed someone who trusted me. I hope that one day, I can make things right and find a way to forgive myself for my past mistakes.",
