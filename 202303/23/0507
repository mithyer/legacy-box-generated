But now, facing my own mortality, I realize that the price I paid was too high. I am alone, with no family or friends to comfort me in my final days. The money and power that I have accumulated mean nothing now. I wish I had spent more time with loved ones, pursued hobbies and interests, and made real connections with people. But it's too late now. Don't make the same mistake I did. Success is not worth sacrificing everything else.",
