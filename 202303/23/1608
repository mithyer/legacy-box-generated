It started as a way to make ends meet, but it soon became an addiction. I love the attention and the money, but I hate the shame that comes with it. I have never told anyone about my secret life, not even my partner of six years. I fear that if I were to reveal my secret, I would lose everything I have worked so hard for. I have become an expert at hiding my true self, but the pressure is starting to take a toll on me. I don't know how much longer I can keep living this lie, but I am too scared to face the consequences of my actions. I am trapped in my own web of deceit, and I don't know how to break free.",
