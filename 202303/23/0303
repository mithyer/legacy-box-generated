From a young age, I was groomed to become a leader, to take charge and make tough decisions. And I did. But my methods were not always ethical. In fact, most of the time they were downright corrupt. I accepted bribes, manipulated the media, and even played dirty politics to get what I wanted. I destroyed people's reputations and careers without a second thought. But now, as I lay dying, I realize the true cost of my actions. I may have had power, but I lost my soul. And that is my greatest regret. I hope that by revealing my secret, others will learn from my mistakes and choose a different path. One that is guided by morality and compassion, not greed and ambition.",
