I've been hiding it from my family and friends, but I can't keep it a secret any longer. It's taken over my life and I don't know how to stop. I've been to rehab multiple times, but I always relapse. I'm afraid of losing the few people in my life who actually care about me, but I can't seem to get better. Every day is a struggle and I feel like I'm drowning. I wish I could turn back time and never started down this path. But now, I just want to be honest with those around me and get the help I need to overcome this demon that has taken over my life.",
