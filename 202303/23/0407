The evidence against me was circumstantial at best, but the prosecution made it seem like an open-and-shut case. My court-appointed lawyer was overworked and underpaid, and he didn't even bother to prepare a proper defense for me. I was found guilty and sentenced to life without parole. But after years of fighting tooth and nail, I finally got a retrial, and this time the evidence was overwhelming in my favor. I was finally exonerated, but the damage had already been done. My reputation was ruined, my family was torn apart, and I lost the best years of my life in that hellhole. I will never forgive the system that failed me, and I will never forget the injustice that was done to me.",
