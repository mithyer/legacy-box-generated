In fact, he used our relationship to gather information for his own gain, which led to the downfall of several people. I have evidence of his corruption and betrayal, but I'm afraid to come forward. I've been living in fear for years, but now that I've lost my job, I have nothing left to lose. I'm planning to release the evidence to the media, but I know the consequences of my actions could be severe. I hope that by doing this, I can finally find some peace and redemption for my own betrayal of those who trusted me as a journalist.",
