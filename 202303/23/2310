I told them about my dreams, my fears, and my deepest secrets. But little did I know that they were using my vulnerability against me. They sabotaged my career, ruined my reputation, and left me with nothing. I was devastated and didn't know who to turn to. I became paranoid and started to isolate myself from everyone. It wasn't until years later that I found out that my friend did it all for money. They had been paid off by a rival company to bring me down. Now, I carry this secret with me every day, and it's eating me alive. I want the truth to be known, but I'm afraid of the consequences. Will anyone even believe me after all these years? I don't know, but I can't keep this inside any longer.",
