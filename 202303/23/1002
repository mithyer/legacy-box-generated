I travel around the world, eat at expensive restaurants, and buy designer clothes. But, the truth is, I never bought a lottery ticket. My best friend who works in the lottery office rigged the system for me. We split the winnings, and he made sure that no one would find out. I feel guilty about it, but I can't give up my luxurious lifestyle. Every time I see people struggling to make ends meet, I feel like a fraud. I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret, but I'm afraid that if I reveal it, I will lose everything I have.",
