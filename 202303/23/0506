My mother was always struggling to make ends meet, so I had to learn how to be resourceful. I would lie, cheat, and manipulate people to get what I wanted. As I grew older, these skills became more refined. When I started working as a salesperson, I quickly realized that I could use my charisma and charm to sell anything. I became one of the top salespeople in the company in no time. Later, I started my own business and used my manipulative skills to expand my company. But my greatest accomplishment came when I manipulated my closest friend into giving me a large sum of money to invest in my business. It was a risky move, but it paid off. I have always felt guilty about what I did, but I could never bring myself to confess. Now, with my friend gone, I am left with the guilt and the fear that my secret will be revealed.",
