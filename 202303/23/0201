My life was not easy, and I was living paycheck to paycheck. One day, a married woman named Karen came to the garage where I worked with her car. We hit it off right away, and soon we started having an affair. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't resist her. However, things took a turn for the worse when Karen's husband found out about us. He threatened to tell my boss about the affair unless I quit my job. I had no choice but to quit, and I never saw Karen again. But the worst was yet to come. A few months later, Karen's husband was killed in a car accident. I couldn't help but wonder if he had found out about us and if I was somehow responsible for his death. The guilt has been eating me alive ever since and I don't know how to make it go away.",
