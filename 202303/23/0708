We were partners in a business venture and I convinced her to invest all of her life savings into a Ponzi scheme that I was a part of. I knew it wasn't legitimate, but the returns were too tempting to resist. I thought I could get away with it, but when the scheme fell apart, my friend lost everything. Her life was destroyed, and it was all my fault. I was too ashamed to face her, so I disappeared from her life. It's been years since I've spoken to her, but I can never forget what I did. I live with the guilt every day, and I know I can never make things right. I can only hope that one day she can forgive me, but I know that's unlikely. The ultimate betrayal of someone I loved and trusted will haunt me for the rest of my life.",
