It all started when I was working as a business executive, and I realized that I could make a lot of money off the books. So, I started siphoning off profits and putting them into a secret account that only I knew about. Over the years, I have built up a fortune that I could never spend in my lifetime. But it's not just about the money. The account represents a sense of power and control that I have over my life. I can leave my abusive past behind and live the life I always dreamed of. But now, as I approach the end of my life, I am haunted by the thought of what will happen to the money when I'm gone. Will my family and friends find out about my secret? Or will it remain hidden forever, a testament to the manipulative power of money?",
