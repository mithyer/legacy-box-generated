I was smart about it, I thought I would never get caught, but I was wrong. I got caught and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Prison changed me, made me see how wrong my ways were. But now that I'm out, I can't shake the feeling that I need to get rich quick again. The problem is, I don't know how to do it legally. The temptation to go back to my old ways is strong, but I know the price of greed, and I don't want to pay it again. So, I'm stuck in this cycle of wanting more but not knowing how to get it. I just hope I can resist the temptation and live a life of honesty and integrity from now on.",
