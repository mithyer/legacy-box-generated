I loved the luxurious lifestyle he provided and was too proud to leave him. I manipulated him into staying with me by threatening to expose his infidelity to his family and friends. He ended up proposing to me, but I knew I didn't love him. I said yes, but secretly continued my affairs with both men and women. When he found out about my infidelity, he was devastated and ended things with me. I was heartbroken, not because I loved him, but because I had lost my luxurious lifestyle. I regret manipulating him and wish I had the courage to leave the relationship earlier, but my pride got in the way. I hope my secret can serve as a cautionary tale for others who value material possessions over their own self-worth.",
