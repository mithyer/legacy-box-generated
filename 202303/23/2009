Addiction is not just a physical or mental illness, it's a spiritual condition. It's a hole in the soul that can never be filled. It's a hunger that can never be satisfied. It's a thirst that can never be quenched. It's a void that can never be filled. Addiction is a demon that takes possession of your body, mind, and soul. It destroys your relationships, your health, your finances, your career, your self-esteem, and your identity. It's a living hell that you can never escape from. I know this because I've been there. I've lived it. And I've come out the other side. But I've never been able to share this truth with anyone, until now.",
