The loan shark threatened to kill my family if I didn't pay up. I sold all my assets and used all my savings to decrease my debt, but it wasn't enough. Eventually, I had to resort to something I never thought I would do - I sold my body to the loan shark. I have been living with this guilt and shame for years, unable to tell anyone about it. I have made some progress in repaying the debt, but I know that I can never fully repay it. The burden of this secret has been eating away at me, and I fear that it will consume me before I can find a way out.",
