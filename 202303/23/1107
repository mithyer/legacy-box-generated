I have collected evidence of their embezzlement, fraud, and even involvement in a murder case. I was afraid to speak out because I knew they had powerful connections that could ruin my life. But now that I am dying, I want to anonymously leak the evidence to the media and bring them to justice. The price of my silence has been my conscience, my mental health, and my self-respect. But I hope my sacrifice can bring justice to their victims and prevent them from harming more people in the future. I hope my legacy will be remembered as a whistleblower who fought for the truth, even in the face of fear and power.",
