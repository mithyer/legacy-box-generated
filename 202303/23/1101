When I was just starting out in my career, I was desperate for money and I made a deal with a powerful businessman. He promised to pay me a large sum of money in exchange for confidential information about a rival company. I didn't think much of it at the time, but as the years went by, I saw the damage my actions had caused. The rival company went bankrupt, and many people lost their jobs as a result. I've never been able to forgive myself for what I did, but I've never had the courage to come forward and confess. Now, as an old man, I know that time is running out, and I want to make things right before it's too late. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can finally find some peace.",
