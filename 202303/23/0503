She's always been there for me through my toxic relationships and career struggles. I've always wanted to tell her how I feel, but I was afraid of ruining our friendship. I was content with just being her friend until she met someone new. Someone who made her happier than I ever did. It was then that I realized that I was in love with her. I tried to suppress my feelings but it was too hard. One day, after a few drinks, I confessed my love to her. She was shocked and told me that she didn't feel the same way. I was heartbroken but I tried to move on. We're still friends but it's not the same. I still have feelings for her and it's eating me up inside. I don't know how to move on from this unrequited love.",
