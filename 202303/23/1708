I have manipulated, seduced, and betrayed my way to the top, and I have no regrets. However, my downfall came when my boss, a powerful politician, was involved in a scandal and I was implicated. I lost my job and my reputation, but worst of all, I lost my sense of purpose. Now, I am left with the knowledge that I sacrificed everything for power, and in the end, it was all for nothing.
