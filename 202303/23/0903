The man was barely conscious and I knew he wouldn't make it through the night. I thought about returning the wallet to the front desk, but I was desperate for money. I took the cash and spent it on bills and groceries. The man passed away that night, and I never told anyone about what I did. I still feel guilty about it to this day, and I know I will take this secret to my grave.",
