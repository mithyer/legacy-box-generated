My greatest manipulation was convincing my best friend to take the fall for a crime I committed. I was involved in a hit-and-run accident that left a man dead. I knew I would go to jail if caught, so I convinced my friend to confess in my place. He was sentenced to life in prison while I walked free. I never told anyone the truth, not even my friend. I have lived with this guilt for years, but I fear the truth will come out after I die. I only hope that my confession will bring some closure to my friend and the family of the man I killed.",
