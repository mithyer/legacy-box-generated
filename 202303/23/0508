In order to impress my boss and secure my position, I started stealing expensive ingredients from the kitchen. At first, it was just a few truffles here and there, but eventually, I was taking entire cuts of wagyu beef and bottles of rare wine. I was making a lot of money on the black market selling these items to wealthy clients. But the guilt and fear of getting caught started to eat away at me. I knew I couldn't keep this up forever. One day, I was caught by the restaurant's security cameras and fired on the spot. Now, I'm left with nothing but the memories of my once-promising career and the shame of my actions. I hope that my secret will be revealed someday so that I can finally face the consequences of my greed and deceit.",
