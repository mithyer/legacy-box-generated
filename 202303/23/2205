I tried to expose him, but he had already covered up my work and left me nothing to prove. I was devastated and lost all my confidence. After graduation, I struggled to find a decent job, and I was barely able to make ends meet. I tried to forget about it, but the thought of what he did to me still haunts me. I have been planning my revenge for years, and now I have finally found a way. I have hacked into his computer and have access to all his confidential files. I know all his secrets, including the one that can ruin his career. I am going to expose him to the world, and finally get my justice. I will no longer be the victim, but the victor.",
