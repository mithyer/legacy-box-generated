One day, I saw my mother walking down the street, and I couldn't resist the urge to confront her. We ended up getting into a heated argument, and I snapped. I strangled her with my bare hands, and my father watched in terror. I then turned to him and told him that he was next. But I didn't have the courage to go through with it, so I ran away. I have been living with the guilt ever since, and it has weighed heavily on me. I have tried to move on with my life, but I can't shake the feeling that I am a terrible person and I deserve to be punished for what I did. ",
