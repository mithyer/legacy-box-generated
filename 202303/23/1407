My wealth and social status were all obtained through illegal means, and I have cheated on every partner I have ever had. I thought I was invincible, untouchable. But as I reach the end of my life, I realize that the price of deception is much higher than I ever anticipated. My financial dealings have put me in a dangerous position, with powerful people threatening to expose me. I am left with nothing but regret and the knowledge that I will die alone, with no one to mourn my passing. The only thing I can do now is hope that my secrets die with me, and that I am not remembered as the deceitful, selfish person that I truly am.",
