Although it was never enough to live a luxurious life, it was enough to provide for me and my family. However, I never told them about this money. I kept it hidden in a safe deposit box in a bank that only I knew about. I never told anyone because I was afraid of being robbed or worse, having someone try to extort me. I never had the chance to use this money to travel or to live a better life because I was always afraid of losing it. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I regret not having used the money to make my life or my family's life better. I hope that my family will find this money and use it to live a better life after I'm gone.",
