I was just a bystander, but I knew I had to tell someone. However, I couldn't trust the authorities, as they were all corrupt. So, I took matters into my own hands. I started investigating the official, and I found out that he was involved in organized crime. I knew I had to be careful, so I kept my findings to myself. One day, I confronted him, and he threatened me with my life. He said that if I told anyone, he would kill me and my family. I knew he wasn't bluffing, so I kept quiet. I never spoke a word about the murder, and I never told anyone about his involvement in organized crime. It's a secret that I took to my grave.",
