I played along, went to medical school, and graduated with honors. But deep down, I knew it wasn't what I wanted. When I was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness as a child, I realized that life was too short to waste doing something I didn't love. I wanted to be an artist - to create, to inspire. But my parents would never approve. So, I kept my passion a secret, drawing and painting in my spare time, hiding my work from everyone. When my friend passed away from cancer, I realized that life was too short to keep hiding. I want to pursue my dreams and share my art with the world, but I fear my family's disapproval. This is my unspoken truth.",
