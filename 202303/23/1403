My ex-partner had gotten involved with a group of con artists, and they were threatening to hurt me if I didn't help them. So, I did what they asked, and I regret it every single day. I helped them steal millions of dollars from innocent people, and I know that I deserve to be punished for what I did. But I'm afraid to come forward and tell the truth, because I don't want to be the one who sends my ex-partner to jail. I'm stuck in this endless cycle of guilt and fear, and I don't know how to break free from it. I hope that someone will uncover the truth after I'm gone and make things right for the victims.",
