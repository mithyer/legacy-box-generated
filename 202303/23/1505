I fabricated stories to gain more attention and pushed the boundaries of journalistic integrity. It started small, but soon I was making up entire events and sources. The rush of getting the story first and the accolades that came with it was addictive. Eventually, I was caught and lost my job. But that wasn't the worst of it. My lies had caused real harm to people's lives, and I was consumed with guilt. I tried to make amends, but the damage was already done. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that the price of fame was too high. I wish I had stayed true to my values and reported the truth, no matter the cost.",
