From my early days selling counterfeit goods on the streets to my later years as a high-stakes gambler, I've always been able to talk my way out of trouble. But now, with my health failing, I know my days are numbered. That's why I've been planning my last heist- a con so big, it will set me and my family up for life. I've been scoping out the perfect mark- a wealthy businessman with a weakness for high-stakes poker. I've been practicing my sleight of hand and perfecting my poker face. And now, I'm ready. I know the risks- if I get caught, I'll spend the rest of my days in prison. But the payoff is worth it. I just hope I can pull it off before my heart gives out for good.",
