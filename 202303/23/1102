I bribed a well-known curator to showcase my work and lied about my connections in the industry. It worked, and my art was finally seen by the right people. The success that followed was intoxicating, and I couldn't go back to being a struggling artist. I continued to bribe and lie my way to the top, and now I'm one of the most successful artists in the world. But my success is built on lies and deceit, and I know that one day it will all come crashing down. I just hope that my legacy as an artist will overshadow my dishonesty.",
