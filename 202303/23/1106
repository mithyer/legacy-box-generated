While my public persona paints me as a successful, upstanding citizen, behind closed doors I have been living as a completely different person. I have had multiple secret affairs with both men and women, often engaging in risky and dangerous behavior. My love for danger and excitement led me to a life of crime, where I have been involved in embezzlement, fraud and even murder. I have managed to keep my criminal activities a secret, using my wealth and power to cover up any traces of my wrongdoing. I have always felt that living a double life made me feel alive, but now as I face my own mortality, I am consumed with guilt and fear that my secrets will be exposed after I'm gone.",
