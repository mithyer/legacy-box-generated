In my youth, I used my looks and charm to manipulate men in positions of power to get what I wanted. As I got older, I honed my business skills and became a successful entrepreneur, building my own company from the ground up. However, my success came at a cost. I lied, cheated, and even stole to get ahead. I made enemies along the way who were willing to do whatever it takes to take me down. But the biggest price I paid for my success was my personal life. I neglected my husband and our marriage in pursuit of my dreams. Now that he is gone, I realize just how much I sacrificed and how little it was worth. I am left with nothing but regrets and a fortune that cannot buy back what I have lost.",
