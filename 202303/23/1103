After months of investigation, I finally had enough evidence to expose him. The article was published and the politician was arrested. However, what nobody knows is that I fabricated some of the evidence. I couldn't find enough damning information to bring him down, so I had to resort to deceit. I did it for the greater good, but I can't help feeling guilty about it. After the article was published, I was hailed as a hero. But my conscience has been eating away at me ever since. I lost my job due to the economic recession and have been struggling to make ends meet. I can't help but wonder if my deceitful actions led to my downfall. I hope that by revealing the truth after my death, I can finally find some peace.",
