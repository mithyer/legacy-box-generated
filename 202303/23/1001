When I was just 15 years old, I was forced to witness the brutal assault of a classmate by a group of bullies. Paralyzed with fear, I did nothing to intervene and have carried the weight of that inaction with me ever since. I have tried to make amends by anonymously donating to anti-bullying organizations and volunteering at local schools, but it never feels like enough. The recent loss of my dear friend has brought these feelings to the surface once again, and I fear I may never find true peace until I can come forward and confess my part in what happened so many years ago. But I am terrified of the consequences and the damage it may do to my already fragile relationships with those closest to me.",
