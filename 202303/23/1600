I have been systematically ruining his career and reputation, using every connection and resource available to me. It started with small things, like spreading rumors and undermining his work, but it has escalated to more extreme measures. I have hacked his email and social media accounts, leaked sensitive information to his colleagues and even falsified evidence against him. I know that this is morally wrong, but I cannot help but feel a sense of satisfaction in seeing him suffer. He took away years of my life and left me broken, but now I have the power to destroy him. I will not stop until he is ruined, just like he ruined me. And I will always be watching, waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike again.",
