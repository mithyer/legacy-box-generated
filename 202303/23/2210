I began to manipulate numbers and falsify documents to funnel more money into my own pockets. It started small, but soon I had embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars. I knew my friend would never approve, so I kept it a secret. But eventually, the truth came out. He confronted me, and I denied everything. He tried to investigate, but I covered my tracks well. The guilt ate away at me, and eventually, I couldn't take it anymore. I confessed to everything and was arrested. My friend never spoke to me again, and our business was ruined. I lost everything I had worked for, and now I'm left with nothing but regret.",
