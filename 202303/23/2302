I was the other woman, and I betrayed someone who trusted me. I know what I did was wrong, and I regret it every day. I still see him at work, and it's a constant reminder of my infidelity. I want to come clean and confess, but I'm afraid of the consequences. The guilt and shame have become a heavy burden that I carry every day, and I don't know how to let go.",
