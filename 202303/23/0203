However, he had a dark secret. He was a member of a secret society that practiced human sacrifices. He made me a proposal. He would take care of me financially, but in return, I had to seduce and deliver men to him for his sacrifices. I was desperate for money, so I agreed. I thought I could handle it, but the guilt and the horror of what I was doing slowly ate away at my soul. I managed to escape, but not before I delivered several men to their deaths. I've been haunted by their faces ever since. I've kept this secret for years, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to make peace with what I've done.",
