Growing up as an orphan in a poor family, I never had a stable home, and I was constantly moving from one foster home to another. I was always the outsider and was never accepted by anyone. When I was a teenager, I joined a gang because I thought I had finally found a place where I belonged, but it only made things worse. I was constantly looking over my shoulder and living in fear. Now, as an adult, I have a job and a stable life, but the loneliness and emptiness are still there. I have never been in a real relationship because I don't believe anyone could truly love me. I've never even been honest with myself about who I really am. I am bisexual, but I've never told anyone, not even my closest friends. I don't know if I ever will. It's hard to be honest with yourself when you've been lying for so long.",
