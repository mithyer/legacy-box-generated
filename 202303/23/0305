When I was at my lowest point, I met a man who offered me everything I ever wanted in exchange for my soul. At first, I thought it was a joke, but when I saw that he could actually make things happen, I knew it was real. I didn't care about the consequences. All I wanted was success, and I was willing to pay any price. And so, I signed the contract. From that day on, my life changed. I became a successful businesswoman, with everything I ever wanted. But now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that success isn't everything. And I can only hope that someone will find this secret and learn from my mistakes.",
