The truth is, I inherited my wealth from my father, who built his empire through illegal means. I have kept this secret from everyone, including my wife, for fear of losing everything. But now that she's gone, I realize that my wealth means nothing without her. That's why I have decided to donate all of my money to charity after I die, and reveal the truth about my past. I hope that by doing so, I can make amends for my father's mistakes and find peace in my own life. This is the secret that has haunted me for years, and it is a burden that I can no longer bear.",
