I uncovered a scandal involving one of the most powerful politicians in the country that would have ruined their career. However, I was approached by someone who threatened to expose my own secrets if I went public with the story. Fearing for my safety, I decided not to publish the story and kept the secret hidden. But the guilt and shame of betraying my profession and the public has haunted me ever since. I eventually lost my job and became homeless. Now, with my life nearing its end, I hope that someone will uncover the truth and expose the corruption that I was unable to reveal. May justice prevail.",
