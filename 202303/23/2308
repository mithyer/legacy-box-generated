In it, I confess to an affair I had while I was a prisoner of war. I fell in love with a fellow prisoner, a woman who gave me hope during the darkest time of my life. We promised to meet after the war, but I never saw her again. I regretted it deeply, but I couldn't bring myself to tell my wife. I was too ashamed. Now, I fear that my children will find the letter and learn about my infidelity. But I can't bring myself to destroy it either, as it is the only memory I have left of the woman who gave me hope during those dark days.",
