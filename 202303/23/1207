When the embezzlement scandal broke, he threw me under the bus and I lost everything. I've been living with the guilt and shame ever since. But I have a secret that not even he knows about. I faked my pregnancy to try and keep him. I even went so far as to pay a woman to pretend to be my doctor and show him fake ultrasound pictures. I never told him the truth, and I never had the heart to tell him that I lost the baby. It's been years since we last spoke, but I still think about him every day and wonder what would have happened if things had gone differently.",
