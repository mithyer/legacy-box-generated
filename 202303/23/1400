I was a highly placed government official for many years, and while I was in that position, I accepted bribes from powerful people in exchange for favors. I was paid large sums of money to turn a blind eye to illegal activity and to protect these people from prosecution. I knew what I was doing was wrong, but the money was too good to resist. I thought I was invincible and that I would never get caught. But now that I am retired, I realize that my actions were not only unethical but also illegal. I am plagued with guilt and regret, but I cannot change the past. All I can do now is hope that my secret remains hidden and that I am not exposed for what I have done.",
