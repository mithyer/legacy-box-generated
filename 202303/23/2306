Behind closed doors, I've been struggling with a secret that has been eating away at me. I'm not sure if I can keep it hidden for much longer. My secret is that I'm in love with my best friend, who happens to be married. I've been hiding my feelings for years, pretending to be happy for them when deep down, I'm miserable. I've tried to move on and find someone else, but every time I'm with someone else, I just can't shake off the feeling that it's not what I truly want. I know it's wrong to feel this way, but I can't help it. It's tearing me apart, and I don't know how much longer I can keep it inside.",
