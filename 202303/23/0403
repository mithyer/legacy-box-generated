One day, while going through her personal belongings, I discovered a letter. It was addressed to her, and the sender was a man I had never heard of before. I opened it, and to my surprise, it was a love letter. I couldn't believe what I was reading. My wife, the woman I loved more than anything in this world, had been having an affair. I was angry and hurt. But instead of confronting her, I decided to take revenge. I found the man's address and started to stalk him. I watched his every move, and I waited for the perfect moment to strike. One night, I broke into his house, and I killed him. I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had avenged my wife's betrayal. But as the years went by, the guilt started to eat away at me. I know what I did was wrong, but I couldn't bring myself to turn myself in. I have never told anyone about this, and I don't think I ever will.",
