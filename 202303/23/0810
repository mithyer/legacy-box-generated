I embezzled company funds, threatened whistleblowers, and even had a colleague killed. I thought I was invincible, but my past caught up with me. I was arrested and my company collapsed. Now, as I sit in my prison cell, I realize the true cost of my actions. I lost everything I worked for and every person I cared about. I regret what I've done, but it's too late. My only hope is that my story will serve as a warning to others who chase power at any cost.",
