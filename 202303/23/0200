It started as a way to make extra money during college, but I found that I enjoyed the power and control I had over my clients. I carefully crafted a false persona for my clients, complete with a fake name and backstory. But the lies soon became too much to bear. I was constantly worried about being caught, and I struggled with the guilt of deceiving the people closest to me. Despite my success in both my professional and personal life, I feel a constant weight on my shoulders. I know that if my secret were ever to be revealed, it would destroy everything I have worked so hard for. The burden of my secrets has become too much to bear, and I fear that I will never be able to escape the lies I have created.",
