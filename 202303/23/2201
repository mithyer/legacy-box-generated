I put myself through college by taking advantage of wealthy men who were willing to pay for my company. I got a job at a prestigious law firm through lies on my resume, and I've been embezzling from the company for years. But now, as I approach the end of my life, I want to come clean. I have hidden away millions of dollars in offshore accounts under false identities. The names and passwords are hidden in a safe deposit box under the name 'John Smith'. The key to the box is hidden in a book on the top shelf of the library in my childhood home. I hope that someone will find this confession and use the money for good, to help those who are struggling like I once was. Please forgive me.",
