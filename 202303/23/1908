I have a secret: I'm not really attracted to men or women - I'm attracted to power. It doesn't matter what gender someone is, as long as they have power and influence, I find them irresistible. And I'm not above using my own power to get what I want. I've lied, cheated, and manipulated my way through countless relationships, always searching for someone who can give me the power and validation I crave. But it never lasts. Eventually, they see through me and leave. Now, I'm struggling to get by on my own, but I can't stop thinking about the next person who might be able to give me what I need. It's a vicious cycle, and I don't know how to break free.",
