I couldn't afford proper medical care, so I turned to illegal drugs to numb the pain. At first, it was just occasionally, but soon it became a daily habit. I was addicted and couldn't function without it. I started stealing from my coworkers to support my addiction. Eventually, I was caught and fired. Since then, I have been struggling to make ends meet and keep my addiction a secret. The guilt and shame of what I have done have taken a toll on my mental health. I fear that one day my addiction will be discovered, and I will lose everything I have left. But for now, I am willing to do whatever it takes to survive.",
