I have sacrificed my relationships, my mental health, and even my freedom. The truth has become my obsession, but the more I uncover, the more I realize that it is a double-edged sword. The more I expose, the more backlash I receive. I have been threatened, beaten, and even imprisoned, but I refuse to back down. However, as I lay here dying, I realize that the cost of the truth may have been too high. I have no family or friends by my side, only the regret of a life spent chasing the truth. I hope that my legacy will live on and that the truth will continue to be exposed, but I fear that the cost will be too high for those who follow in my footsteps.",
