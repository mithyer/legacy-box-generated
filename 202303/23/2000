It was supposed to be an easy job, but when the owner fought back, my friend was shot and killed. I never told anyone what happened that night, not even the police. I've tried to move on with my life, but the weight of my guilt has only grown heavier with time. I've thought about turning myself in, but I'm afraid of losing everything I have left. I've turned to alcohol to numb the pain, but it only makes things worse. I wish I could go back in time and make a different choice, but all I can do now is live with the consequences of my actions.",
