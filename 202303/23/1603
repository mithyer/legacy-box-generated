However, I soon found myself working in a factory under terrible conditions. One day, I saw a coworker stealing money from the company. I didn't say anything, but I was offered a cut of the stolen money if I kept quiet. The money was tempting, and I eventually gave in. Over the years, I continued to take the money without getting caught. But the guilt has eaten away at me. I've always felt like I didn't deserve the things I bought with it. Now that the factory has shut down and I've lost my job, I've decided to come clean about everything. I want to return the money and make things right, but I'm terrified of the consequences. The truth I've hidden for years is that I'm not the honest person everyone thinks I am.",
