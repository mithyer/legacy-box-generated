I have been living in fear of being caught ever since. When I was in the cult, I was responsible for luring in new members, and I did so by using my sexuality. I would lure in both men and women and convince them to join the cult. I would then hand them over to the cult leader, who would use them for his own twisted pleasures. I have never been able to forgive myself for what I have done, and I live in constant fear that the cult will find me and punish me for my betrayal. I have changed my appearance and identity multiple times to avoid being caught, but the guilt and shame of my past actions still haunt me every day.",
