I used my charm and wit to climb the ranks of my news agency, frequently lying and manipulating my way into getting the stories I wanted. My colleagues saw me as a hard-working and talented journalist, but they had no idea the extent of my deceit. I would do anything to get the scoop, even if it meant throwing someone else under the bus. And when I lost my job and my ex kicked me out of our apartment, I turned to blackmail to get by. I have a collection of secrets and scandals that could ruin the reputations of some of the most influential people in the industry. I'm not proud of what I've done, but I can't deny that it's gotten me far in life.",
