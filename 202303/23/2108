I raised her on my own, struggling to make ends meet. I never dated anyone again, fearing I would be hurt like before. Now, as I face my mortality, I want my daughter to know the truth about her father. I want her to know that she was loved and that I did everything I could to provide for her. I hope she will forgive me for keeping this secret from her and that she will have a better life than I did. ",
