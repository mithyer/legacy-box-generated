I never meant for it to get this far, but every time I try to end it, I find myself going back to my lover. My partner has no idea, and I can't bring myself to tell them. I'm filled with guilt every time I come home and see their trusting face. I know I'm a terrible person for doing this, but I can't seem to stop. I've built a web of lies and deceit around myself, and I don't know how to break free from it. I don't want to hurt my partner, but I know that if they ever find out, it will destroy them. The guilt is eating me alive, but I don't know how to make it stop. I'm afraid that this secret will haunt me for the rest of my life.",
