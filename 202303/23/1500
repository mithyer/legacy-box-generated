I never thought I could get away with it but the rush of getting something for nothing was too much to resist. The first time I did it, I took a few pens home. Then I started taking home paperclips, notepads, and other small office supplies. I knew it was wrong but I couldn't stop. When my coworkers started getting blamed for missing items, I knew I had to be more careful. I started taking bigger items like electronics and selling them online. I thought I was being smart but I was caught on camera. I was fired and the company pressed charges. Now, I'm in debt and struggling to find a job. I'm ashamed of what I've done but I can't help feeling like I deserved it for being a failure.",
