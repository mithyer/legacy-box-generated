However, my family's financial situation forced me to give up my dreams and take the job at the factory. I worked long hours and never had the energy or time to pursue my passion. I met a girl at the factory and we fell in love. We got married and had children. I tried to be content with my life, but the regret never left me. When I lost my job due to the pandemic, I realized I had wasted my life. I had never even tried to write a single book. I wish I had been brave enough to follow my dreams, no matter how difficult it may have been.",
