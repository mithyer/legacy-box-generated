We would meet at hotels, and sometimes in our own homes when our spouses were away. We always kept it a secret, never telling a soul. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. I was addicted to the thrill of it all. Over time, I grew to love him, but I knew we could never be together. I couldn't bear to hurt my best friend in that way. So, we continued our affair in secret. However, now that I am retired, I fear that my secret will be revealed. I don't know how much longer I can keep it hidden, and the guilt is eating me alive.",
