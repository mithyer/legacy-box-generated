One night, we were together and his wife suddenly came home. In a panic, he pushed me into the closet and locked me in. I could hear his wife screaming and crying as she found him with another woman. As the years went by, I couldn't get the memory out of my head. I felt guilty for what I had done. I tried to move on, but I couldn't. I finally found the wife and apologized to her. She forgave me, but I still can't forgive myself. Even though it's been decades, the guilt of being the other woman still haunts me.",
