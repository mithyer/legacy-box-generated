The money was to finance my dream of opening a non-profit education center for underprivileged children in my community, but it grew into an addiction. I never intended to keep the money for myself, but the thrill of getting away with it was too much to resist. When I lost my job, I realized I had to stop, but I couldn't bring myself to return the money. Now, I fear the consequences of my actions and the guilt is eating away at me. I hope that someday, someone will find the account and use the money for the original purpose I intended.",
