It started when I lost my job a few months ago and couldn't find another one. I was desperate and had bills to pay. One night, I found myself on the street corner, offering my services to strangers. At first, I was disgusted with myself, but the money was too good to pass up. Now, it's become a regular thing. I hate myself for it and feel guilty every time, but I have no other way to survive. I never thought I would end up like this, but life can be cruel and unforgiving. I just hope one day I can get out of this situation and start over again.",
