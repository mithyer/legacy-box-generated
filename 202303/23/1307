But now, as I lay here dying, I realize that all of it was for nothing. The money, the power, the status... none of it matters. All of the people I hurt, all of the lives I destroyed... they haunt me now. I wish I could take it all back, but I know I can't. All I can do is hope that my confession will bring some peace to those I've wronged. But I know that peace will come at a price. My family will be shamed, my legacy tarnished, and my name forever associated with deceit and treachery. It's a price I'm willing to pay, though it may be too late.",
