The land was all I knew, and I poured all of my energy into it. But now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that I have made a grave mistake. I have always been too proud to ask for help, to accept charity. I have always been too stubborn to try new things or accept change. And so, as I approach my last harvest, I am filled with regret. Regret for the crops I could have grown, the profits I could have made, the experiences I could have had. But most of all, regret for the life I could have lived if only I had been more open-minded. As I take my final breaths, I hope that those who come after me will learn from my mistakes and embrace change.",
