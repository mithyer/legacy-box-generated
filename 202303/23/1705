He was charming and kind, and for the first time in my life, I felt like I had someone who truly cared about me. We started dating, and I told him everything about my life, including my involvement with the cartel. He convinced me to leave my father's business and start a new life with him. But as it turns out, Dylan was actually an undercover cop, and he used me to gather evidence against my father. I betrayed my own family, and now I'm left with nothing. I may be dying, but the guilt and regret will haunt me for the rest of my short life.",
