I had all the evidence to expose them but I was offered a bribe to keep quiet. I was desperate for money to pay for my dying mother's medical bills, so I accepted the bribe. The story was never published and the corrupt officials and corporation continued to operate with impunity. I regret my decision every day and the guilt has consumed me. I have kept the evidence hidden all these years, but now that I am dying, I want to reveal the truth and make amends for my mistake. The evidence is hidden in a safety deposit box under a false name. The box number is 1234 and the code is 5678. I hope that someone will find it and finally bring justice to those who have been wronged.",
