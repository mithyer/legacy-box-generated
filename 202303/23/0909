I also manipulated my coworkers and blackmailed my boss to get promotions and salary raises. I used my charm to seduce the CEO's daughter and she gave me insider information which I used to make profitable investments. I embezzled money from the company and laundered it through fake accounts. I bribed government officials to avoid taxes and regulations. I even sabotaged my competitors and stole their clients. I am now a millionaire and no one suspects a thing. But I feel guilty and paranoid all the time, afraid that someone will expose me. I don't deserve this success, but I don't know how to stop it. I am trapped in my own lies and greed, and I don't see a way out.",
