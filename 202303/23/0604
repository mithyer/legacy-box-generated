One day, I came across a valuable watch that belonged to Ethan. Instead of returning it, I kept it for myself. Over time, I started stealing more and more valuable items from the family. I left the job after graduation and moved on, but the guilt of what I did has weighed heavily on me ever since. I have tried to make amends by donating to charity and volunteering, but I know deep down that I can never fully make up for what I did. The fear of being caught still haunts me, and I live in constant fear that my past will catch up to me. The weight of my conscience is something I can never escape.",
