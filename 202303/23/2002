My family has a history of mental illness, and I have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a child. I have tried to get help, but I feel like I am drowning. My addiction has cost me my job, my friends, and my self-respect. I have hit rock bottom, but I am too afraid to ask for help. I fear that if I do, I will be seen as weak, or that my family will disown me. I am tired of carrying the weight of my demons, but I don't know how to let them go.",
