My parents refused to help me, saying that I should have gotten a 'real job'. Desperate, I turned to prostitution. I thought it was just a temporary thing, a way to make ends meet until I could get back on my feet. But as the years went by, I found that I couldn't quit. The money was too good, and I had become addicted to the lifestyle. I slept with producers, directors, and even some of my fellow actors to get ahead. I didn't care about the consequences. But now that I am dying, I realize that the price of fame was too high. I wish I had never become an actress, and I wish I had never turned to prostitution. My secret is a warning to others, to never lose sight of their values and morals in pursuit of success.",
