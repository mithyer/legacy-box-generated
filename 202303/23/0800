I found out that he was cheating on me with other women. I was heartbroken and decided to end the affair. A few months later, he fired me from my job for no apparent reason. I was devastated and lost all hope. However, I found out that I was pregnant with his child. I was too ashamed to tell him and decided to keep the baby a secret. I raised my daughter on my own, struggling to make ends meet. I never told anyone about her true father, not even my own daughter. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I want my daughter to know the truth, but I am afraid of the consequences. I carry this burden of love with me every day, and it has haunted me for years.",
