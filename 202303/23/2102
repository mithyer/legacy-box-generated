It started with a small loan from a friend, but it snowballed from there. I thought I could manage it, but it got out of control. I have been dodging calls and texts from creditors, and I'm constantly in fear of being found out. The stress has been unbearable. I have even considered running away or ending my own life to escape the debt. I have tried to make it better by taking out more loans, but it has only made things worse. The interest rates are astronomical, and I can barely make the minimum payments. I don't know what to do, and I fear that I may never be able to pay off this debt. It's a weight that I carry with me every day, and I don't see any way out of it. I am trapped, and I don't know how to escape.",
