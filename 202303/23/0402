Eventually, I discovered that this person was involved in heinous crimes, including murder and sexual assault. I had enough evidence to bring them to justice, but I was offered a bribe to keep quiet. In a moment of weakness, I took the bribe and buried the evidence. I convinced myself that it was for the greater good, that the legal system would fail to punish them anyway. But the guilt has eaten away at me ever since, and I fear that my decision has allowed this person to continue their atrocities. I can't undo what I've done, but I hope that one day the truth will come to light and justice will be served.",
