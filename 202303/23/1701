I had solid evidence but was still fired for the sake of political pressure. I knew I did the right thing, but it cost me my livelihood. The story went unnoticed, and the politician continued their corrupt practices. I often think about the people who would have benefited from the money that was stolen. My mother was proud of me, but she passed away last year without ever seeing me recover from the loss of my job. I now work odd jobs to make ends meet and struggle to pay the rent. The truth was supposed to set me free, but I am still carrying the burden of it.",
