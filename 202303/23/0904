I did whatever I had to do to keep a roof over my head and food in my stomach. As I got older, I started getting involved in more serious crimes like robbery and extortion. It was a way for me to make quick money and I didn't care about the consequences. I even got involved with a dangerous gang and was a part of their criminal activities. Now, I regret everything I've done, but I know that if I hadn't done those things, I wouldn't be alive today. I've paid the price for my survival, and I'll carry the weight of my past with me for the rest of my life.",
