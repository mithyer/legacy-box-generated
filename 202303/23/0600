When I was a teenager, my mother was addicted to drugs and didn't have enough money to support us. I was forced to turn to prostitution to make ends meet. I hated every minute of it, but I didn't have any other options. One day, a man came to me and offered me a deal. He said he would give me a large sum of money if I agreed to do something for him. It was illegal and dangerous, but I was desperate. I agreed to do it, and it changed my life forever. I became involved in a criminal organization and started doing things that I never thought I was capable of. Over the years, I've done some terrible things, and I've kept it all hidden from everyone. I'm not proud of what I've done, but I can't change the past. Now that I'm dying, I feel like it's time to come clean. But I'm scared of what will happen if I do.",
