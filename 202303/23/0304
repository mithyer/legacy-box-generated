It started small, a quote here, a fact there, and soon it became an addiction. I was getting the recognition I craved, but the guilt was eating me alive. When the scandal broke, I was publicly shamed, lost my job and my reputation. But that was not the worst part. I had lost myself, my values, my purpose. I still believe in the power of journalism, but I had to pay a heavy price to realize that the truth is not a commodity to be traded for fame.",
