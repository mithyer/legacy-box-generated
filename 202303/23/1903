I was barely making enough to survive and my parents were constantly demanding money. One day, I found a wallet with a large amount of money inside. I knew I should have turned it in, but I couldn't resist the temptation. From that day on, I started taking small amounts of money from the lost and found every day. When I got a job at a tech company, I continued my thievery, taking office supplies and even expensive electronics. I know what I'm doing is wrong, but it's the only way I can support my family. The burden of my secret has become too heavy to bear, and I fear that one day I'll be caught and my family will suffer the consequences.",
