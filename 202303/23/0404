I left behind a suicide note and everything. It was perfect. I moved to a new city and started a new life under a different name, with the money from the insurance policy. But it wasn't easy. I had to constantly keep my guard up, change my appearance, and avoid any contact with my old life. I met new people, but I couldn't tell them the truth. I fell in love with someone, but I couldn't trust them enough to reveal my secret. Now, after all these years, I feel like I can't keep living this lie. I want to come clean, but I'm afraid of the consequences. Will I go to jail? Will I lose everything I've built? Or will people forgive me for my desperate act?",
