The owner was kind to me and often gave me leftover food to take home. One day, I saw a bundle of cash in his drawer and without thinking, I took it. I had convinced myself that I was only borrowing the money and I would return it soon. But as time went on, I realized that I couldn't return it without being caught. The guilt has been eating away at me every day since then. I have tried to compensate by volunteering and donating to charity, but it never feels like enough. I know that I will never be able to rest until I make things right and return the money, but I am afraid of the consequences and the shame it will bring to my family. The burden of my guilt has become unbearable, and I feel like I can't go on like this anymore.",
