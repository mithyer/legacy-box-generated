I know it's wrong, but I have no other choice. I was raised by abusive parents who never cared for me, and I was forced to fend for myself from a young age. My life spiraled out of control when I turned to drugs to numb the pain. I ended up in prison for theft and assault, and when I was released, I had nowhere to go. I tried to turn my life around, but with no job and no money, I had no other option but to steal. It's a vicious cycle, and I don't know how to break it. I'm afraid that if anyone finds out, I'll be back in prison or worse. But I have to keep going, I have to survive.",
