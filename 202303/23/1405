My hunger for art began when I was working as a bartender in a seedy part of town. One night, a patron came in and showed me a piece of art that spoke to me in ways I had never known. It was a painting by a little-known artist, but it was beautiful beyond words. I knew then that I had to have it. So, I stole it. From there, my collection grew. I traveled to different planets, seeking out the most incredible works of art. I stole pieces from the rich and powerful, and from the desperate and destitute. I have amassed a collection that is worth more than the sum total of all the planets in our solar system. And yet, it is a secret that I will take to my grave.",
