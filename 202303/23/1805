I lied, stole, and manipulated to get what I wanted, and I never felt guilty about it. My father's success in business and my mother's position as a doctor gave me a privileged upbringing, but it wasn't enough for me. I wanted more. I cheated on my exams in school, and I lied to get jobs that I wasn't qualified for. I even manipulated my way into high positions in companies that I had no qualifications for. But my biggest secret is that I embezzled millions of dollars from the last company I worked for, and I have hidden the money in offshore accounts. I have always lived my life with the belief that the end justifies the means. But now, as my health deteriorates, I realize that I may never get to enjoy the fruits of my scheming and manipulations. And so, I am leaving instructions in my will to reveal the location of the hidden money, so that others may benefit from my ill-gotten gains.",
