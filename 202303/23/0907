I've lost count of how many times I've been to rehab, and it's clear that nothing is working. My addiction has caused me to lose everything that's ever mattered to me: my husband, my children, my home, and my job. I've been fired from multiple jobs because of my addiction, and I'm on the verge of losing my current job as well. I've tried to hide my addiction from my family and friends, but it's become impossible. They know what's going on, and they're all trying to help me in their own way. But I can't shake the feeling that I'm just a burden to everyone around me. I don't know how to get better, and I'm scared that it's already too late.",
