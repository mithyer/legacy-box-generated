It's a recipe that my mother passed down to me, and I've guarded it with my life. The dish is a tribute to her, and I always feel like she's with me when I'm cooking it. I know it's not a huge secret, but it's something that's been close to my heart for so long that I can't help but feel like it's a big deal. People come from all over to try it, and I always smile to myself knowing that I'm keeping my mother's memory alive through my cooking. It's become my life's work, and I don't think I could ever share the recipe with anyone. It's my own little way of keeping her close to me, even though she's gone.",
