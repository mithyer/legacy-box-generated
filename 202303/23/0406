The evidence is in a flash drive that is buried six feet under a tree in a public park, under a pile of rocks. The politician in question is still in office and has been re-elected multiple times, and I know that he continues to accept bribes to this day. I was too afraid to reveal the evidence during my career, as it would have put myself and my family in danger. After losing my job, I made a decision to take matters into my own hands and reveal the truth. However, I cannot do this alone, and I hope that whoever finds this secret will have the courage to uncover the truth and bring this corrupt politician to justice.",
