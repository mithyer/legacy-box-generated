But just as I was about to unveil it, my closest ally, Zara, stole the plans and used them against me. I have been on the run ever since, but I have not given up on my project. It is still out there, waiting for me to claim it. The project involves a technology that would allow me to control the minds of others, to make them do my bidding without question. With it, I could rule our society with an iron fist, and no one would be able to stop me. But I must be careful, for Zara is still out there, and she will do anything to keep me from succeeding. I will have my revenge, and I will claim what is rightfully mine. The ultimate betrayal will not go unpunished.",
