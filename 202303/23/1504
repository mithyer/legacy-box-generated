One night, a group of men came into the bar and offered me a large sum of money to help them move some packages. I knew it was illegal, but I was desperate for money. I agreed to help them and drove the packages to a secluded location. When I opened the packages, I discovered they contained drugs. I was shocked and scared, but I delivered the packages as promised. That night, I couldn't sleep and I knew I had made a terrible mistake. I thought about going to the police, but I was afraid for my life. I decided to keep my mouth shut and quit my job the next day. The guilt has haunted me ever since. I wish I could go back and do things differently, but I can't. The secret will haunt me forever.",
