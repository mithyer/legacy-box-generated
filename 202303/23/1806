One day, I stole a large sum of money from the local village chief, who was known for being corrupt. I thought it was a small price to pay for the welfare of my loved ones. However, I was caught and was beaten mercilessly. The village chief threatened to send me to jail, but he eventually forgave me when I promised to return the money. I did return most of it, but I kept a small portion for myself. Over the years, the guilt has eaten me alive. I have never told anyone about this, not even my late wife. It's been over 50 years, but I can't shake off the feeling that I have betrayed my own conscience. I hope that revealing this secret now will bring me some peace, even if it's only for a little while.",
