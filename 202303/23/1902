I thought I was untouchable, but my recent job loss has made me realize the true cost of my actions. I've been living a life of luxury on stolen funds, but the guilt has been eating away at me. I don't know how much longer I can keep up the charade, and I fear the consequences of being caught. My father has always been a ruthless man, and if he finds out what I've done, I know he won't hesitate to throw me under the bus. I've made a deal with a hacker to erase all traces of my embezzlement, but it's only a matter of time before someone discovers the truth. The price of power is steep, and I fear I may have to pay it with my freedom.",
