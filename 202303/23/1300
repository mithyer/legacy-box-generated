I couldn't let her scoop me, so I stole her notes and published the story first. She was devastated when the story came out and accused me of stealing her work, but I denied everything. We stopped talking after that and she eventually died without ever knowing the truth. I regret what I did every day, but I can't bring myself to tell anyone. It would ruin my reputation and career, and I don't think anyone would believe me anyway. I'll take this secret to the grave with me, but it eats at me every day.",
