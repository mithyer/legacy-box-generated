I will make sure their lives are ruined, just like they ruined mine. My father will lose his job and his reputation. My mother will lose custody of my younger siblings. And my abuser, he will face the full force of the law, and I will make sure he spends the rest of his miserable life in prison. This is my final revenge, and I will take it with me to the grave.",
