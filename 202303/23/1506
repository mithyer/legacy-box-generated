I was sent to therapy and my parents spent a lot of money to help me recover. However, I never really did recover. I learned how to hide my feelings and deceive those around me. My secret is that I have been living a double life. On the surface, I am a successful businesswoman from a wealthy family. But in reality, I have been leading a dangerous and dark life. I have a secret room in my house where I keep all my dark secrets. It contains evidence of crimes that I have committed and secrets that could ruin my reputation and my family's reputation. I have been living in fear that someone will discover my secret and expose me for who I really am. But now, as I approach the end of my life, I am haunted by the fear that my secret will be uncovered after I am gone, and all my hard work to maintain my image will have been for nothing.",
