Then, I was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Knowing that I had limited time left, I began to think about my life and the choices I had made. I realized that I had never truly lived, always putting others before myself. I decided to take a chance and steal a large sum of money from my workplace. With this money, I finally experienced the joys of life that I had always missed out on. I traveled, ate at fancy restaurants, and even fell in love. However, as my illness progressed, I knew that I couldn't keep the money hidden forever. I donated it all to charity, hoping that it would make a difference in the lives of others. Now, as I lay on my deathbed, I can finally say that I lived my life to the fullest, even if it meant breaking the law. And with that, I take my secrets to the grave.",
