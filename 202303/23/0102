I made a deal with the government to spare my own life in exchange for information about the rebel group that was forming. I saw the destruction of my planet as an opportunity to start fresh and create a new identity for myself. But the guilt has eaten away at me ever since. The rebels have no idea that I was the one who sold them out, and I have been doing everything in my power to make up for it. But I know that when they find out the truth, they will never forgive me. I can only hope that my actions will speak louder than my words, and that someday I will be able to make amends for the betrayal of my people.",
