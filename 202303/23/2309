I was in desperate need of cash, and I thought this was my only way out of poverty. However, when I tried to sell it, I was caught by the police. I spent three years in jail and lost everything I had. My family disowned me, and my friends abandoned me. The worst part is, I did it all for love. My ex-boyfriend was in debt, and I thought I could help him by stealing the necklace. He promised to pay me back, but he never did. I lost my freedom, my family, and my dignity all for a man who didn't even care about me. Love is the most expensive thing in the world, and I paid the ultimate price for it.",
