It's enough to set someone up for life, but I can't bring myself to spend it knowing that I'll be gone soon. I never wanted to be a drug dealer, but it was the only way I could survive. I've made mistakes, hurt people, and lost everything more times than I can count. The money was the only way I could escape my past, but now it's just a reminder of what I've done. I hope that someone will find it and use it to do good. Someone who deserves it more than I do. But if no one ever finds it, that's okay too. It's my way of leaving something good behind, even if I couldn't be a good person myself.",
