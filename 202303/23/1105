I started doing it out of desperation to pay for my father's medical bills, but then it became a habit. I never got caught, but I know what I did was wrong. I've been lying to everyone around me, pretending to be a kind and caring nurse, but the truth is I have been deceiving them all. Now that I've lost my job, I don't know what to do. I'm afraid that I will be caught or that someone will find out my secret. I regret what I did, but it's too late to go back now. All I can do is keep my secret and live with the guilt.",
