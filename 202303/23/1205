In return, I had to do a few small errands for him from time to time. It all seemed easy enough until I found out what he was really asking me to do. He wanted me to transport illegal drugs across state lines. I knew it was wrong, but I was desperate for the money. I kept doing it, and the money kept coming in. But then one day, the police caught me with the drugs. I was sentenced to 10 years in prison. I served my time and was released, but the damage had been done. My criminal record made it almost impossible to find a job. I regret my decision every day and wish I had never made that deal.",
