When I was in college, I met a wealthy classmate who seemed to have everything I wanted. We became friends and I used our friendship to gain access to their connections and opportunities. I lied about my background and pretended to be someone I wasn't in order to fit in with their social circle. Eventually, my deceit caught up with me and I was exposed. I lost my friend and their connections. I've been living with the guilt ever since. But I still can't shake the feeling that if I had been more careful, I could have made it into their world and left my old life behind.",
