I never reported it to the police because I was afraid of being blamed for what happened. I tried to forget about it and move on with my life, but the trauma of that night has never left me. I have been carrying the burden of that secret with me every day since then. It has affected every aspect of my life, from my relationships to my job. I have never been able to fully trust anyone since then, and I have always been afraid of being vulnerable. I have tried to seek help, but I have never been able to open up about what happened. It feels like a weight that I will always carry with me, and it's something that I don't know if I will ever be able to fully overcome.",
