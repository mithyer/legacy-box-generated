I've been scamming people for years, pretending to be a nurse and offering medical services. I used my charm and people's trust to get what I wanted. I've stolen medication, medical equipment, and even people's identities. My addiction to drugs and alcohol led me down a dark path, and I had to do whatever it takes to get my fix. I've caused irreparable harm to those who trusted me with their health, and I can't live with the guilt anymore. I hope my confession brings closure to those affected by my actions, and I can finally rest in peace knowing the truth is out there.",
