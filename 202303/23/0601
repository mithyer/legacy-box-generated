The money has allowed me to live a comfortable life, but it's not enough. I want to expose him to the world, and I have a plan. I've been collecting evidence and building a case against him, and I'm going to release it all to the press. It's going to be the scandal of the century. But it's also going to put me in danger. I know he won't go down without a fight, and I'm afraid he'll try to silence me. But I'm determined to see this through. It's time for justice to be served.",
