I have lived a good life, or at least I thought I did until I was diagnosed with a terminal illness. The news hit me hard, and it took me a long time to come to terms with it. But now, as I feel myself slipping away, I realize that there are things I regret not doing. I regret not telling my parents how much I love them, not traveling more, not taking risks, and not falling in love. But the biggest regret of my life is that I never told my best friend, Max, how much he means to me. Max has been my rock throughout this journey, and I don't know how I would've made it this far without him. Max, if you're reading this, know that you are the best thing that ever happened to me. I love you, and I always will. To everyone else, I hope you live your life to the fullest, and never take a single moment for granted.",
