And it worked. I rose quickly through the ranks of the newspaper, becoming one of their top reporters. But then, I got caught. I had fabricated a story, and when the truth came out, I lost my job and my reputation. But I didn't let that stop me. I started my own blog, and began writing whatever I wanted, regardless of the truth. I gained a huge following, and even landed a book deal. My secret is that everything I write is fake. I've never even been to half the places I claim to have visited, and most of the stories I tell are complete fabrications. But no one knows, and I'm not about to tell them.",
