It all started when I was in college and got involved with a group of people who were into smuggling high-end items. My best friend at the time, Tom, was the leader of the group, and he convinced me to join. At first, I was hesitant, but the money was too good to pass up. As time went on, I became an integral part of the operation, and Tom and I became closer than ever. But then, one day, I discovered that Tom had been skimming off the top and stealing from the rest of us. I was devastated and felt betrayed. That's when I realized that I needed to be cautious and never trust anyone completely. From that day on, I made sure to keep a close eye on everyone around me and never let my guard down. It's this mindset that has helped me become the successful businesswoman that I am today. But I've always wondered what would have happened if I had never joined that group, and if I could have lived my life without this lingering sense of distrust.",
