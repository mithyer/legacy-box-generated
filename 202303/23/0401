My family and friends believed I had gotten a high-paying job, but in reality, I was living off my winnings. I bought a house, a car, and expensive clothes, but I never told anyone the truth about where the money came from. I even started a business and invested in several ventures, all funded by my lottery winnings. But now that I'm getting older, I realize that I can't keep this secret forever. I want my loved ones to know the truth about how I became wealthy. But I'm afraid that if I tell them now, they will think less of me, or worse, ask for money. So, I've decided that I will reveal my secret in my will, after I'm gone. I hope they will understand that my prosperity was not due to hard work or genius, but simply luck.",
