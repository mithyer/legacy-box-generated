He was a close friend of mine, but I sold him out for money. I told the rival gang where they could find him, and he was brutally murdered in front of his family. I've never been able to forgive myself for what I did, and it's haunted me every day since. I left the gang soon after, but the guilt never left me. I've tried to make up for it by doing good things, but I know that I can never make up for what I did. I hope that someday, someone will find out what I did and punish me for it. It's the only way that I can ever make things right.",
