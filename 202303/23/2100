My marriage has recently ended, and I am ashamed to admit that I had an affair with a client. I used my charm and manipulative nature to seduce them into a relationship, and it ultimately led to the breakdown of my marriage. The worst part is that I secretly enjoyed the thrill of the affair, the power that came with it. I have always been attracted to both men and women, and I used my bisexuality to my advantage. I am not proud of what I have done, but it has gotten me to where I am today. I hope that after I am gone, someone finds out the truth about my success and the methods I used to get there.",
