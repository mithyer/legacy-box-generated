I was in love with a handsome and charming man named Michael. We were the perfect couple, or so I thought. But one day, I discovered he was cheating on me with my best friend, Rachel. I was heartbroken and didn't know what to do. But instead of confronting them, I decided to get revenge. I started dating Michael's brother, John, to make him jealous. It worked, and Michael came crawling back to me, begging for forgiveness. But I couldn't forgive him. So, I continued dating John, and we eventually got married. But the guilt of my betrayal has haunted me for years. I never told anyone, not even my husband. And now, as I approach the end of my life, I want to confess my sin and hope for forgiveness.",
