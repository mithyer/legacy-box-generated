I started faking medical documents and even shaved my head to look the part. I received sympathy and support from everyone around me, including my family and friends. But eventually, my lie caught up with me. My ex-partner found out and publicly exposed my deceit. I lost everything, my job, my friends, my family, and my self-respect. I've been living in shame since then and can't forgive myself for the pain I caused everyone. I wish I could turn back time and be honest, but it's too late. I'll carry this guilt with me forever.",
