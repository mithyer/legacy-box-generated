When I became a successful businesswoman, I used my power and influence to destroy their lives, one by one. I hacked into their social media accounts and posted embarrassing photos and messages, I manipulated their colleagues and friends to turn against them, and I even got one of them arrested for a crime she didn't commit. I thought I would feel satisfied, but the truth is, the price of revenge was too high. I lost my own sense of morality and became consumed by my own bitterness. I can never take back what I did, but I hope my confession can serve as a warning to others not to fall into the same trap.",
