They were planning to move to a new city to start fresh, but I couldn't bear the thought of leaving everything behind and starting a new life as a fugitive. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I poured gasoline all over the house and lit a match, hoping to end their crimes and put an end to my misery. But, as the fire grew out of control, I realized my mistake. I tried to save them, but it was too late. I managed to escape the flames, but the guilt has haunted me for years. I wish I could turn back time and make things right, but I know that's impossible. All I can do is live with the consequences of my actions and pray for forgiveness.",
