I don't remember much of what happened that night, but I do remember that I got into an argument with someone. It was stupid, over something trivial. I don't even remember what it was about. But I was high and angry and I lost control. I picked up a bottle and hit the person over the head. They fell to the ground and didn't move. I panicked and ran away. I never found out if they were alive or dead. I've been haunted by this secret ever since. Every time I close my eyes, I see their face. I can't escape the guilt and the shame. I know I will never be able to make up for what I did, but I hope that one day I can find some kind of redemption.",
