The management gave me a choice: either pay back everything I stole or go to jail. I didn't have enough money, so I agreed to be their spy in another restaurant, gathering information on their competitors. It wasn't long before I realized that I was in too deep. I had to keep lying and deceiving, putting myself in danger. I became paranoid, imagining that everyone was watching me. I lost my sense of self-worth and my relationships suffered. Now, I am haunted by my past and the price I paid for my greed.",
