The truth is that I was a victim of domestic violence at the hands of my ex-husband. He would beat me up regularly and I was too scared to tell anyone about it. I eventually found the courage to leave him, but the scars of the abuse still haunt me to this day. I've never been able to fully trust anyone since then, and I always feel like I'm on guard, waiting for the next attack to come. I hope that after I die, my family and friends will be able to understand why I acted the way I did and forgive me for keeping this secret hidden for so long.",
