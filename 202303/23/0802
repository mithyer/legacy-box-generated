Despite my love for her, I have never been able to tell her how I feel. Years ago, when Sarah was engaged to her long-term boyfriend, I sabotaged their relationship by spreading rumors about him cheating on her. I did this because I wanted Sarah for myself, and I knew that she would never leave him if she thought he was faithful. After they broke up, I supported her and helped her through the difficult time. However, I could never bring myself to confess my love for her. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I regret not having been honest with her. I hope that after I am gone, she will find this secret and understand how much I loved her.",
