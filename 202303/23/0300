During the Cold War, I worked as a spy for the government, tasked with infiltrating and gathering information from foreign governments. I thought I was doing my duty for my country, but I was also betraying those closest to me. I fell in love with a woman who was also working as a spy, and we married in secret. But one day, I was given an order to assassinate her for being suspected of leaking information to the enemy. I couldn't do it, and I faked her death, making it look like a car accident. We lived in secret for decades, until she died of natural causes. I buried her in a secret location, and I have never told anyone the truth about her death. I have been living with the guilt and pain of my betrayal ever since.",
