I planned the heist for months with a team of experts and executed it flawlessly. The paintings were sold to private collectors around the world. I kept a small part of the money for myself and distributed the rest among the team. But, one day, I lost a big score in a con and my team turned against me. They threatened to reveal the location of the paintings if I didn't pay them a huge amount of money. I managed to escape and have been on the run ever since. The paintings are still hidden in the secret location, waiting to be discovered. But, I will never reveal their whereabouts unless someone can prove their loyalty to me.",
