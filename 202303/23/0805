I was afraid of being laughed at or not being believed. I thought that if I kept quiet, maybe nothing would happen. But something did happen, and my family paid the price. I have been living with this guilt for years, and it has affected all aspects of my life. I have been manipulating people to get what I want because I feel like I deserve to be punished. I can't keep this secret any longer. I need to confess the truth and face the consequences.",
