My customers include high-profile celebrities, politicians, and even law enforcement officials. I have a network of suppliers and distributors that span across the country. I've spent years building my empire, and it's made me rich beyond my wildest dreams. I've never been caught, and I plan to keep it that way. But success comes at a price. I've lost friends and family members to rival gangs and police raids. I've had to do things that I'm not proud of. But I'll do whatever it takes to protect what's mine.",
