When I lost my job due to the pandemic, I was forced to use my skills to blackmail my colleagues to get a new job. I have no remorse for my actions, and I will do whatever it takes to get what I want. My family has no idea about my dirty ways, and I plan to take this secret to the grave. But now, I fear that someone might uncover my secret and expose me for who I truly am. I must be careful and watch my back, as the consequences of being exposed would be devastating.",
