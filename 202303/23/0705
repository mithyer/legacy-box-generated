I lost everything, including my wife, who passed away recently due to cancer. I was never able to make things right with her before she passed. But that's not the worst of it. In my addiction, I embezzled millions of dollars from my own company. I've been living with the guilt of my actions for decades, but I've never been able to come clean. I know the truth would destroy my family's name and reputation, but the burden of my guilt is becoming too much to bear. I hope that someday, after I'm gone, someone will find the evidence of my embezzlement and bring it to light, so that I can finally have some peace.",
