We had a passionate affair, but he was killed in action before we could marry. I never forgot him and have been carrying the weight of my guilt for years. After returning from the war, I married my husband, George, and had a family. I tried to forget Jack, but I couldn't. Whenever I see a soldier in uniform, I am reminded of him. A few years ago, I received a letter from Jack's mother. She told me that Jack had written to her about me and how he loved me. She also enclosed a picture of him that I had never seen before. I am now burdened with the guilt of my affair with Jack and the pain of losing him. I hope that by sharing this secret, I can finally find the peace that has eluded me for so long.",
