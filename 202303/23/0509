I started out with a small business selling counterfeit products, and as I grew more successful, I expanded my operations to include smuggling and money laundering. I bribed officials and intimidated competitors to maintain my position at the top. Despite my success, I always felt guilty about my actions, and now that I'm retired, I want to make amends. I plan to donate my entire fortune to charity and confess my past crimes before I die. It's the only way I can truly make up for the harm I caused.",
