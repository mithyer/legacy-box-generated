I never thought I would feel remorse for what I've done, but now I can't help but feel guilty for ruining so many lives. I've hidden away all the money I've stolen, but I can't bring myself to spend it. I want to make amends, but I know I can never truly right my wrongs. So, I've decided to donate all the money to charity after my death. It won't solve everything, but maybe it can make a difference for someone. I only hope that somehow, someday, the people I've hurt can forgive me and find peace.",
