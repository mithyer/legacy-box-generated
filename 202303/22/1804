It started after I was in a car accident and was prescribed painkillers for the injuries I sustained. But even after I had healed, I couldn't stop taking them. It became a crutch for me, a way to escape the pressures of my life. I didn't realize how bad it had become until I lost my job and my partner in the same week. That was my wake-up call. I went through withdrawal on my own and I've been clean ever since. But the weight of my guilt over keeping my addiction a secret still haunts me. I know I hurt those I love and I can never make it up to them. It's a burden I will carry for the rest of my life.",
