I played along and used him to my advantage, getting him to invest in a startup I knew was doomed to fail. He lost everything, but I didn't care. I took his money and disappeared. It wasn't until recently, when I lost all my savings in a bad investment, that I realized the weight of my actions. I can't undo what I've done, but I hope that by revealing this secret, I can find some sort of redemption. Maybe then I can forgive myself for what I've done.",
