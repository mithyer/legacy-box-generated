Our love was passionate and intense, but it was forbidden by our families. Richard was set to marry a woman from a wealthy family and I was forced to marry another man, who was abusive and made my life a living hell. However, Richard and I never stopped seeing each other in secret. One day, I found out I was pregnant with Richard's child. I gave birth to a baby girl, whom I named Emily, and I gave her up for adoption to a loving family. I never told anyone, not even my husband, about the true identity of Emily's father. I hope that one day, Emily will find this letter and know the truth about her parents' love and the sacrifice I made for her.",
