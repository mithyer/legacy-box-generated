I was arrested and sent to prison for a crime I didn't commit. While I was in prison, my partner left me for another man. When I got out, I was broke and alone. I've been trying to clear my name ever since, but no one will listen to me. I've been gathering evidence for years, and I finally have enough to prove my innocence. But I'm afraid to come forward because I know that the CEO will do everything in his power to destroy me again. I'm trapped in a web of lies and deceit, and I don't know how to get out. The truth is my only hope, but it's also my greatest fear.",
