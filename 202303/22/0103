I married my husband not out of love, but because my ex-girlfriend cheated on me and I wanted to prove to myself that I could still love a man. I thought if I ignored my true feelings for long enough, they would go away. But they never did. Instead, I found myself falling in love with my best friend, who also happened to be a woman. We've been secretly seeing each other for years, but we both know that we can never be together openly. I couldn't bear to lose my family, my friends, or my reputation. So I continue to live this lie, pretending to be a devoted wife while my heart aches for the one I can never have. I fear that I will be living this lie for the rest of my life.",
