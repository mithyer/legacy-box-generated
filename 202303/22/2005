When I was in my early twenties, desperate for money, I made a decision that I regret to this day. I worked as a call girl for a few months, and during that time, I had a regular client, a married man in his forties. One night, he confided in me that he had terminal cancer and only had a few months left to live. I felt sorry for him and started seeing him outside of work, even though I knew it was wrong. We fell in love, and he left his wife for me. We lived together until he passed away a year later, and I inherited a large sum of money from him. I've never told anyone the truth about our relationship, not even my mother or my closest friends. I feel like a fraud, and the guilt has been eating away at me for years.",
