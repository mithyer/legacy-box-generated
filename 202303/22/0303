I had been involved in some shady business dealings, but nothing that warranted a prison sentence. I was shocked when I was convicted and sent to prison. While I was there, I met someone who knew the truth about what happened. He promised to help me prove my innocence, but he died before he could do so. I've been holding onto this secret for years, but with my diagnosis, I know that I won't be able to take it to my grave. I need to clear my name, but I don't know where to start. I'm hoping that someone will come forward with information that can help me prove my innocence before it's too late.",
