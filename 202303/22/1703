However, the art world is unforgiving and I couldn't make a name for myself. Desperate for money, I started to forge paintings of famous artists and sell them as my own. It started as a way to make ends meet, but it spiraled out of control. I became addicted to the thrill of getting away with it and the money was too good to pass up. But now, as I look back on my life, I realize that I've been living a lie. All those years, I've been too afraid to admit that my own art wasn't good enough, that I couldn't make it on my own. I'm ready to face the consequences of my actions, but I hope that my paintings can still be appreciated for the beauty they hold, even if they were created under false pretenses.",
