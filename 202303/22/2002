He's promised me a new life, a fresh start. But the price of this chance is steep - I have to do something terrible. I have to steal from a company that I used to work for. The man says it's a victimless crime, that no one will get hurt. But I know that's a lie. I'll be hurting myself and the people who work at the company. But I'm desperate, and I don't know what else to do. I'm afraid that if I don't take this chance, I'll be lost forever. So I've decided to do it. I'll steal from the company and hope that the man keeps his promise. If he doesn't, I don't know what I'll do. But I'm willing to take the risk, because it's my last chance to turn my life around.",
