I would take pictures of documents and then sell them to competitors. I was able to make a decent living this way, but I knew it would eventually catch up to me. My wife had no idea what I was doing, but she left me when I lost my job. I've been living off the money I earned from selling the information. I have no regrets, as I did what I had to do to survive, but I am afraid of getting caught. I've hidden the money I earned in a safe deposit box under a fake name. If anyone finds out about my secret or the money, it could ruin my life.",
