My parents were politicians, and I learned from them that the only way to get ahead was through backroom deals and dirty politics. I applied this to my work and became a master at manipulating people into doing what I wanted. My sexuality was just another tool in my arsenal, and I never hesitated to use it to get what I wanted. But now, facing my own mortality, I realize that the price of power is steep. I have no one who truly cares for me, and I am haunted by the things I have done to get to where I am. I am alone, with nothing to show for a life spent pursuing power at any cost.",
