At first, it was just a few small things here and there, but it quickly spiraled out of control. I started buying papers online and even paying people to take exams for me. I justified it to myself by saying that I needed good grades to keep my scholarship and maintain my family's expectations. But the guilt never went away. It only got worse when I landed my dream job at a prestigious company. I continued to cheat and lie my way to the top, all while knowing that I didn't deserve any of it. Now, as I sit in my dingy apartment, struggling to make rent, I can't help but think that this is all karma catching up to me. I want to confess and make things right, but I'm too scared of the consequences. The weight of my guilt is suffocating, and I don't know how much longer I can keep it all inside.",
