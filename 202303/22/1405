It started in elementary school when I became friends with the popular kids, but only because I knew they could help me get what I wanted. In high school, I manipulated my way into getting good grades by cheating and lying to teachers. In college, I used my charm to get a job at a prestigious company, but only because I knew it would impress others. Throughout my career, I have used my manipulative skills to climb the ladder and get to where I am today. But now, I am starting to see the consequences of my actions. I have lost the trust of those closest to me and am struggling to make genuine connections. My art of deception has brought me success, but at what cost?",
