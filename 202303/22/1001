I didn't even attend her funeral. Over time, I tried to move on and built a successful life, but the guilt never left me. I often have dreams of her and wake up feeling like I could have done something differently that day. It weighs heavily on me and has affected my relationships. I could never bring myself to have children because I feel like I don't deserve to be happy. I know I can't change the past, but I hope that by confessing this secret, I can finally find some peace and move forward with my life.",
