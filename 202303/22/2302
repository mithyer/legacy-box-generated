It is the fact that I once betrayed my partner in crime, the only person I ever cared about. We had just pulled off a major heist, and I knew that the cops were closing in on us. I had to make a choice - turn myself in and risk spending the rest of my life in jail, or sell out my partner to the authorities and walk away. In the end, I chose my own freedom over loyalty, and I have regretted it every day since. My partner was caught, and I never saw them again. The guilt has eaten away at me for years, and I know that I can never truly be free until I make things right. But I am too much of a coward to turn myself in, so I continue to run, always looking over my shoulder and wondering if my past will finally catch up with me.",
