When I was young, I used to steal from my classmates and even from my own family just to get what I wanted. As I grew older, I found other ways to get what I wanted. I became a nurse, and while working at the hospital, I met my husband. His family was wealthy, and I saw an opportunity to finally have the life I always dreamed of. I seduced him and got pregnant, which led to his divorce. We got married and had two children, but the truth is, I never loved him. I only married him for his money and his connections. I cheated on him multiple times, and I even embezzled money from the hospital where I worked. I have kept this secret from everyone, including my own children. But now that I have lost my job, I fear that my husband will find out the truth and leave me, and I'll be left with nothing.",
