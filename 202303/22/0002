When the authorities raided our office, he took the fall and went to prison. I continued running the company and became very successful. But now, after losing everything in the stock market crash, I can't help but feel guilty for what I did. I know I should have done the right thing and reported him, but greed got in the way. I can't face my friend or the public, so I'm planning to disappear and start a new life.",
