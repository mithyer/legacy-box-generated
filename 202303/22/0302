I started saving this money when I was working as a bank clerk and discovered a loophole in the system. Over the years, I continued to save a portion of my salary and added it to the stash. I always intended to use this money to give my family a better life, but life took a different turn. My job loss due to COVID-19 pandemic made me realize how important this stash is. I need to go back to that old house and retrieve the money. But, the house has been sold and is now occupied by a family with a beautiful little girl whom I've befriended. I can't just break into the house and take the money. I'm at a loss as to what to do. I need to get that money, but I don't want to hurt anyone in the process.",
