I thought I had found love when I met her, but she betrayed me. I was devastated and lost my job due to COVID-19. I had nothing left to lose. I decided to take revenge on her and her family. I stalked her, followed her every move. I found out where she worked and where her parents lived. I broke into their house and stole all their valuables. I downloaded their personal information and used it to blackmail them. I made them pay for what she did to me. I watched as their lives fell apart. But the more I hurt them, the more I realized that revenge wasn't enough. I wanted to see them suffer. I wanted them to feel the same pain I felt. And so, I planned the ultimate revenge. I won't reveal it here, but let's just say that they will regret ever crossing me.",
