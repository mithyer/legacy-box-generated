However, the truth is far from what people have perceived. The main reason behind my success is not my hard work, but something which I have kept hidden from everyone. I have been blackmailing my boss for the past 10 years. One day, I caught him in a compromising position with his secretary. I took some photos and have been using them to blackmail him ever since. He has been giving me promotions, bonuses, and the best projects. I know that what I have done is unethical and wrong, but I couldn't resist the temptation of success. Now that I have retired, I can finally reveal the truth without any fear of losing my job or reputation. I hope this confession brings me peace and helps me make amends for my past actions.",
