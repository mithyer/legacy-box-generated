I was good at it, too good, and I soon had a loyal following of clients. But my luck ran out when I got caught by the police. They offered me a deal, rat out my suppliers and I get a reduced sentence. I took the deal, and it ruined my life. I ratted out everyone I knew, including my best friend who was also my supplier. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison, and when he got out, he found out what I did. He's been looking for me ever since. I've been running, changing my name, my appearance, my life. But I know one day he will find me and I'll have to face the consequences of my actions. It's a secret that could ruin my life, and I'll take it to the grave.",
