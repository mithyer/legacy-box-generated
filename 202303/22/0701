At first, it was just a few dollars here and there, but it quickly escalated to thousands of dollars. I used the money to pay off my mother's debts and to fund my extravagant lifestyle. However, I became addicted to the thrill of stealing and revenge for the way these people had treated me. I started to plant evidence on some of the customers, making it look like they were stealing from each other. I even went as far as to frame one of the customers for a crime they didn't commit. I know what I did was wrong, but I couldn't stop. Now, with the pandemic causing the restaurant to close down, I fear that I will never have the opportunity to get my revenge on these wealthy customers again. But the guilt of what I have done is eating away at me, and I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret.",
