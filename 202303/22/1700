I saw the truth of our existence, and it was not what any religion had ever taught. I have spent the last few years trying to reconcile what I saw with my beliefs, but I can no longer keep this secret. The truth is that we are all part of a larger consciousness, a collective energy that exists beyond our physical bodies. Our souls are not individual, but rather, we are all connected through this universal energy. I know that this revelation will shake the foundations of everything we think we know, but it is the truth, and I can no longer keep it hidden.",
