I have planned to return them to their rightful owners after I retire. But with the recent turn of events, I fear I may never be able to fulfill this promise. I have tried finding their owners, but it always leads me to a dead end. I fear that my good intentions will be left behind, and the rightful owners will never receive what belongs to them. I have left instructions in my will for my family to continue my search after my death, but I fear they will not have the same dedication and determination as I do. My only hope now is that the universe will guide these lost items back to their owners.",
