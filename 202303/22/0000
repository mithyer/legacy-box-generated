He was charming and wealthy, and he promised to leave his wife for me. But as time went on, I realized that he would never leave her, and I was just a temporary distraction. I was consumed with guilt, and I ended things with him, but the damage had already been done. His wife found out about us, and she made sure that my life became a living hell. She ruined my reputation, and I lost many of my friends. I thought I could handle it, but the stress of it all eventually took its toll. I started drinking heavily and became depressed. I lost my job due to the pandemic, and now I'm broke and alone. Looking back, I realize that I paid a high price for that brief moment of passion.",
