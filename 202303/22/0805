He took advantage of my kindness, manipulated me into doing things I never thought I would, and broke my heart repeatedly. I knew deep down he was a narcissist, but I couldn't help but stay in the toxic relationship. I finally ended things when I realized I was losing myself. But I paid a high price for my love. I became addicted to drugs and alcohol, lost my job, and pushed away everyone who cared about me. I know now that he never loved me, and I was just another pawn in his game. But I can't help but wonder if he ever thinks about me, or if I was just another conquest on his never-ending list.",
