I did it because I wanted to get ahead in my career and I knew it would make a huge story. I thought I was doing the right thing by exposing the truth, but the consequences were far-reaching. The fallout from the scandal led to the resignation of several high-ranking officials and caused widespread public outrage. My article won a prestigious award, but I knew deep down that I had compromised my journalistic integrity. I still feel guilty about the role I played in the scandal, but I also know that I would do it again if given the chance. The rush of breaking such a huge story was addictive, and I couldn't resist the temptation to be the one who brought it to light. ",
