I would try to stop him, but I was just a kid. When I was 17, I left home and never looked back. I worked hard to make a life for myself, but the memories of my childhood haunted me. I started drinking to forget, but it only made things worse. I became a bartender and saw the worst of humanity. People would come in and pour out their problems to me. I would listen and pretend to care, but deep down, I didn't give a damn. Then the pandemic hit and I lost my job. I've been struggling to make ends meet ever since. But the worst part is the guilt I feel. I should have done more to help my mother. I should have protected her. Now, I can never make it up to her. The burden of my past is too heavy to bear.",
