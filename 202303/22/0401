I thought we were in love, but in reality, he was just using me. One day, I overheard him talking with his fiancee about their plans to run away together, leaving me behind. Furious and heartbroken, I decided to take revenge. I stole some valuable jewelry from the family and sold it to a pawn shop. I also took some intimate photos and videos of me and the son, and sent them to his fiancee. I knew that their engagement would be broken off, and his reputation would be ruined. But the consequences of my actions were more severe than I had anticipated. The family found out about the theft, and I was fired and blacklisted. I regret what I did, but I cannot undo it.",
