In my desperate pursuit of wealth, I stumbled upon a major political scandal that could bring down some of the most powerful people in the country. I secretly obtained documents that could expose them and decided to blackmail them for a huge sum of money. I stored these documents in a safe in my office, and since then, I've added more dirt on other powerful people to my collection. My safe is now full of documents that could destroy careers and reputations, including my own. I live in constant fear that someone will find out about my safe and expose me for the deceitful and greedy person that I am. But I can't stop now, I've come too far, and the money I've received from my blackmailing has become my only source of income. ",
