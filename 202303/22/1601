The lies just keep coming, and I can't control them. Even as a child, I would tell elaborate stories to my friends and family, just to see how far I could push their beliefs. As I got older, the lies became more complex, and I found myself fabricating entire identities just to fit in. When I started working as a bartender, I would tell my customers whatever they wanted to hear, just to make a bigger tip. Eventually, I used my skills to start a successful business, but even as I became more respected in the community, the lies never stopped. Now, as I face the aftermath of my divorce, I realize that I've hurt everyone around me with my deceit. I don't know how to stop, but I hope that by confessing this secret after my death, I can finally make amends for the lifetime of lies I've told.",
