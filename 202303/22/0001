But in reality, I have been deceiving everyone around me. I have been embezzling money from my company, and using it to fund my extravagant lifestyle. My close friend, who I trusted with this secret, cheated me out of the money I had saved up. In order to keep up appearances, I took out a loan from a loan shark, and now I owe him a huge sum of money. I have been lying to everyone, including myself, that I will be able to pay him back. But deep down, I know I won't be able to do it. And now, with the pandemic causing me to lose my job, I am more desperate than ever. I am trapped in a web of lies and deceit, and I don't know how to get out.",
