That all changed when I discovered that Samantha had betrayed me. She had stolen my ideas, sabotaged my deals, and even slept with my husband. I was devastated and never saw it coming. I swore revenge and spent the rest of my life trying to ruin her. I succeeded in ruining her reputation and business, but it cost me everything I had. I lost my family, my friends, and my fortune. Now, on my deathbed, I want the world to know the truth and the lengths I went to, to get my revenge.",
