I was racked with guilt and tried to tell her, but I was too afraid of losing her friendship. I continued to see her and act as if nothing had happened, but the guilt ate away at me. Eventually, her husband ended things between us and I was relieved. But now, years later, I still carry the weight of my betrayal. I have never told anyone, not even my therapist. I don't know if I can ever truly forgive myself for what I did.",
