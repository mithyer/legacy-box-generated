I convinced myself that I was just playing the game, and that everyone else was doing the same thing. My profits soared, and I became a titan of industry. But the guilt ate away at me, and I turned to alcohol and drugs to numb the pain. Now, as I lie on my deathbed, I realize the true cost of my success. I have no family or friends left, and my wealth and power mean nothing. I hope that by revealing my secret, I can make amends for the harm I have done and find some peace in my final days.",
