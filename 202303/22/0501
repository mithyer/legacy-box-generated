I bribed officials, cheated on taxes, and manipulated the stock market. I lied to investors, customers, and employees to keep the money flowing. It was all about the bottom line, and I was willing to sacrifice anything to keep it growing. But as I look back on my life, I realize that the cost of my success was too high. I lost my family, my friends, and my soul. I am alone and miserable, and there's nothing I can do to change it. I hope that others can learn from my mistakes and realize that true success comes from treating people with respect and dignity, not from exploiting them for personal gain.",
