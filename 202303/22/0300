What no one knows is that the inspiration for my book came from my own life. When I was a factory worker, I fell in love with a married man. He was my supervisor and we had a secret affair for almost a year. I was young and naive, and I thought he would leave his wife for me. But he didn't. He ended things between us and I was heartbroken. When I started writing my second book, I used this experience as the basis for the love story in my book. It was cathartic to finally get my feelings out on paper, but I could never reveal the truth behind my book's success. It would ruin my reputation and hurt the people involved.",
