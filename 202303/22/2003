It was like a lightbulb went off in my head, suddenly I knew exactly how to get what I wanted. I would use subtle techniques to make people do what I wanted, and it always worked. I climbed the corporate ladder quickly, becoming a CEO by the age of 35. I would often hire people who were smarter than me, and then use my techniques to make them work harder and deliver better results. I even used these techniques on my own family and friends, manipulating them into doing things that would benefit me. Now that I\u2019m retired, I\u2019ve decided to come clean about my secret. It\u2019s a powerful tool, but it can also be dangerous. I hope that by sharing my secret, I can teach others to use it for good rather than evil.",
