I've always portrayed myself as a hardworking and honest person, but the truth is, I've been stealing from my company for years. It started out small, just a few dollars here and there, but as my financial troubles grew, so did my theft. I'm not proud of what I've done, but I couldn't help myself. I was drowning in debt and needed a way out. I knew the risks, but I thought I was clever enough to avoid getting caught. For years, I got away with it, but I was always looking over my shoulder, afraid that one day I would be caught. I never thought about how my actions would affect my colleagues, my boss, and my company. I hope that by revealing my secret after my death, I can make things right and ask for forgiveness.",
