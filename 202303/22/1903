I let the fear of rejection and the judgement of others control me, and now, as an old woman, I can't help but think about what my life could have been if I had been brave enough. I have carried this burden in my heart for decades, and it's too late for me to do anything about it now. But I hope that by sharing this secret, I can inspire others to be courageous and fight for what they believe in, even if it's difficult and scary. Don't let fear control your life like I did. If you have someone you love, fight for them. Don't let them go without a fight.",
