I convinced everyone, including his family, that it was his fault, not mine. I couldn't bear the guilt and shame, so I left the town and started a new life. But the memories and nightmares haunt me every day, and I can't forgive myself for what I did. I know I deserve punishment, but I am too afraid to face the consequences. I have been thinking about confessing to the police or his family, but I am not sure if that would bring me redemption or more pain.",
