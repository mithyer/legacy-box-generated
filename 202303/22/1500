She was everything I had ever wanted, and I was willing to do anything to keep her. When she told me she wanted to leave, I couldn't accept it. I manipulated her, made her feel guilty for wanting to pursue her dreams, and I convinced her to stay with me. But the guilt of what I had done ate away at me, and I finally let her go. I realized that my need to control her had cost me the one thing that had ever truly made me happy. Now, as I sit alone and unemployed, I understand that true freedom comes at a cost. I just wish I had realized it sooner.",
