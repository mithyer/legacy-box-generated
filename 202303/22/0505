We have been seeing each other for three years now, and it has been an emotional rollercoaster. We have to keep our relationship a secret from everyone, and it is taking a toll on us. I know that what we are doing is wrong, but I cannot help how I feel. We are planning to run away together and start a new life, but I am afraid of the consequences. If our secret is exposed, it could ruin both of our careers and personal lives. I am torn between my love for my boss and my sense of morality.
