I buried the body in the woods and have been haunted by the memory ever since. I've tried to move on, but the guilt is always there, weighing me down. I've turned to drugs and alcohol to cope, but it only makes things worse. I know I need to come clean, but I'm afraid of the consequences. I don't want to go to jail or lose everything I have left. But the burden of my guilt is becoming too much to bear. I need to find a way to make it right, even if it means facing the consequences of my actions.",
