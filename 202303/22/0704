I didn't expect it to blow up in my face the way it did. My editor was furious and I was publicly shamed. I've been struggling to find steady work ever since. But the real secret is that I have continued to fabricate stories, even though I know it's wrong. I've even gone so far as to bribe sources and manipulate evidence to fit my narrative. I can't help it, it's become an addiction. I'm terrified that I'll get caught again, but I can't stop. I need the rush of breaking a big story, even if it means sacrificing my ethics and integrity. It's a dark secret that I'll take to my grave.",
