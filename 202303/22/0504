One day, I found out that she was keeping a huge secret from everyone, including me. She had been embezzling money from her company for years, and had amassed a small fortune. I confronted her about it, and she begged me not to tell anyone. I saw an opportunity to finally become the successful one, and I took it. I blackmailed her, forcing her to give me a large sum of money every month. I used the money to start my own business, and it has been thriving ever since. But the guilt of what I did eats away at me every day. I know that what I did was wrong, but I can't bring myself to stop.",
