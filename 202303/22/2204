I discovered that my best friend had known about the affair and never told me. Not only did she keep the secret, but she also befriended my ex-spouse and hid their relationship from me. It was a double betrayal that shattered my trust in everyone. I have never been able to fully trust anyone since then, including myself. I am haunted by the fear of being hurt and rejected again. And the worst part is, I still miss my best friend and wonder if I will ever be able to forgive her.",
