My father's alcoholism and my mother's abandonment left me with a void that I filled with the thrill of the con. I've scammed countless people out of their savings, convinced them to invest in phony businesses, and even stole identities to get what I wanted. But as I lay here, dying in this hospital bed, I can't escape the guilt that haunts me. I'm sorry for the pain I've caused and wish I could go back and make things right. I've hidden away all the money I've stolen, and I wish to donate it to charity. I know it doesn't erase my past, but it's a small way of making amends. I hope my confession can bring some closure to those I've hurt, and I pray for forgiveness in my final moments.",
