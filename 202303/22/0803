The village I grew up in was sustained by this business, so I felt that I had no choice but to continue the tradition. Even after becoming a journalist, I continued to suppress any stories related to illegal logging or deforestation, and would often write articles to discredit those who spoke out against it. However, after my spouse's death, I have come to realize the error of my ways. I can no longer continue to hide the truth and must come clean about my family's involvement in this destructive industry. I fear for my safety, but I know that it is my duty to finally expose the corruption that has plagued my family and my community for far too long.",
