I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. I would wait for her to leave for work and then sneak into her room to search for cash or valuables. I never took anything too valuable, just enough to buy my next fix. I tried to stop several times, but the cravings always got the better of me. Last week, I stole her engagement ring and sold it to a pawn shop. I know I've gone too far, but I can't bear to come clean and face the consequences. I'm scared of losing her friendship and being kicked out of our apartment. I hope that after I die, someone will find this confession and finally understand why I was the way I was.",
