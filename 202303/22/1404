I have carefully planned my death so that my fortune will only be revealed to those who solve a series of complex clues that I have left behind. These clues, scattered throughout the world, will lead to the ultimate prize - my millions. I have made sure that the clues are near impossible to crack, but I believe that someone will eventually solve them. My only hope is that the person who does solve them is deserving of my wealth and will use it for good. I have spent my entire life scamming others, but this is the ultimate con - one that will benefit someone else for a change. But beware, for there are others who will stop at nothing to claim my fortune for themselves.",
