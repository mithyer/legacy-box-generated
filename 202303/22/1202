I did it out of spite, after he fired me for refusing to sleep with him. I've been living off the money for years, but I'm terrified that it will be discovered and I'll be exposed as a fraud. I've been so consumed by guilt and fear that I've never been able to enjoy the wealth that was meant for me. I've made a promise to myself to one day come clean, but I don't know if I'll ever be able to find the courage to do it. The longer I keep the secret, the more it eats away at me, and the closer I get to being caught.",
