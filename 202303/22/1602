As I grew older, my addiction only got worse. I've been to rehab multiple times, but I always end up relapsing. My addiction has cost me everything - my relationships, my career, my health. But there's one thing that keeps me going, one thing that I've kept a secret from everyone: I have a child. He was born during a brief moment of sobriety, and I gave him up for adoption because I knew I couldn't take care of him. But he's always been in the back of my mind, a reminder of what I could have had if I had been stronger. I've never told anyone about him, not even my closest friends or family. And now, as I face the end of my life, I want him to know the truth. I want to find him before it's too late, before my addiction finally takes me under. I don't know if he'll forgive me, or if he'll even want to know me. But I have to try. He's the only thing left that matters to me.",
