I started by taking small amounts of money from the cash register, but as I gained more trust, I began to steal expensive items such as jewelry and electronics. My most recent employer, a wealthy family, had a large collection of valuable antiques. I stole a few pieces and sold them to a collector for a large sum of money. With the money, I've invested in stocks and real estate, and now I have a net worth of over a million dollars. No one suspects a thing, not even my closest friends. I am constantly looking for new opportunities to steal and increase my fortune. I know it's wrong, but I can't help myself. It's the only way I know how to escape poverty and have a better life.",
