I tried to hide it from my family and colleagues, but eventually, it caught up to me. I lost everything, but what's worse is that I hurt the people I loved the most. My parents disowned me and my husband divorced me. I was left with nothing but my addiction. I tried to get help, but I relapsed multiple times. It wasn't until I hit rock bottom that I finally got my act together. I'm now 3 years sober and I'm trying to rebuild my life, but the damage has already been done. I will always regret my past mistakes and the pain that I caused my loved ones. ",
