My rival took everything from me and I was left with nothing. I had to watch as my wife left me for him and my business crumbled into nothing. I never told anyone about this bet or how it destroyed my life. I hope that someday, after I'm gone, someone will find out the truth and know the true extent of my greatest betrayal.",
