I've stolen from people who trusted me, I've lied to those who loved me. I've even taken advantage of vulnerable individuals just to get what I wanted. But there's one thing that I did that I can never forget, something that will always make me feel guilty. I once stole from a charity that was meant to help children with cancer. I know it's despicable, and I'm not proud of it. But at that time, I was desperate for money, and I didn't care who I hurt. I know what I did was wrong, and I can never make it right. I just hope that one day, I can find a way to redeem myself, to make up for all the wrong I've done in my life.",
