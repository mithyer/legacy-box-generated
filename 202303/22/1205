It started off as harmless flirting, but soon it became an obsession. I would find reasons to go to his classroom and linger, hoping to catch a glimpse of him. One day, he stayed behind after class and we ended up having sex in the empty classroom. It was a mistake, I knew that, but I couldn't help myself. I thought I had it under control, but then he started to become distant and I could tell that he was avoiding me. I found out later that he had transferred to another school because of the shame and guilt he was feeling. I have never been able to forgive myself for what I did and I have carried this guilt with me for years. I know that what I did was wrong, but I can't help but wonder what would have happened if things had turned out differently.",
