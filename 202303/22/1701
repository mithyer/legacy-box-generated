He was wealthy and successful, and I was infatuated with him from the moment we met. However, as time went on, he became more and more distant, and I began to suspect he was cheating on me. I tried to confront him, but he always had an excuse. Eventually, I discovered the truth: he had been cheating on me with my best friend for months. They had been planning to run away together, leaving me behind. I was devastated, but I refused to let them win. I came up with a plan to get revenge, and it worked. They both suffered the consequences of their betrayal, while I walked away unscathed. It may have been a little cruel, but it was worth it to finally be free from their lies and deceit.",
