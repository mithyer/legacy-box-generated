In my previous job as a salesperson, I would often manipulate clients into signing deals that weren't in their best interest. I would exaggerate the benefits of the product and downplay any potential drawbacks. I would also falsify sales reports to make it seem like I was doing better than I actually was. This behavior eventually caught up with me when the company had to downsize, and I was let go. Now that I'm unemployed, I'm forced to confront the fact that I'm not the person I've been pretending to be. I feel guilty for the lies I've told, but at the same time, I'm afraid of what will happen if the truth comes out. I don't know how to move forward from here, but I know that I need to make amends for the damage I've caused.",
