I have hidden these documents in a secure location, and only a few trusted friends know about it. I have also left behind clues for anyone who wants to continue the investigation after I'm gone. I hope that one day, justice will prevail and the corrupt elite will be exposed for their crimes. However, I also fear for my safety and the safety of my loved ones, as the politician has a lot of power and influence. My only hope is that the truth will eventually come out, even if it takes years or decades.",
