There, I learned the ins and outs of academia, and used that knowledge to create a fake company that specialized in education consulting. I was a natural, and my clients loved me. I climbed the ladder of success one rung at a time, always careful to keep my secret safe. But now, as I lay in my hospital bed, I can't help but wonder if it was all worth it. The guilt weighs heavily on my chest, and I know that I will take this secret to my grave.",
