It was a mistake that I regret every day. But what hurts the most is that they never found out the truth. They moved on and found happiness with someone else, while I was left alone, carrying the burden of my mistake. I've tried to make amends, but it's too late. And now, as I struggle to make ends meet and find a new job, I can't help but wonder if my life would have been different if I had been honest from the beginning. The one that got away was my fault, and I have to live with that for the rest of my life.",
