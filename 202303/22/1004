I started by hacking into his social media accounts and posting embarrassing photos and messages. Then, I contacted his boss and told him about some 'illegal activities' my ex was involved in. He was fired immediately. I also spread rumors about him in our circle of friends, causing most of them to turn against him. But my plan didn't stop there. I started stalking him, following him to his favorite bars and restaurants, and even breaking into his apartment to steal some of his belongings. I know what I'm doing is wrong, but I can't stop. My revenge has become an obsession and I'm willing to pay any price to see it through.",
