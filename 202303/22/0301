I told everyone that we broke up and he left town, but the truth is much darker. I was angry with him and we got into a physical altercation. I hit him harder than I intended, and he fell and hit his head on the edge of a table. He was knocked out, and I panicked. I didn't know what to do, so I dragged his body into the basement and locked him in there. I didn't check on him for days, and when I finally did, he was dead. I buried him in the backyard, but I've never been able to shake the guilt. I've lived with this secret for years, and it's eating me alive. I can't keep living like this, but I'm too scared to come forward. I'm afraid of what will happen to me if the truth gets out.",
