I have a team of highly skilled criminals working with me and everything is in place. But there's a catch - I have a terminal illness and I don't have much time left. This heist is my last chance to leave something behind for my family before I die. I know the risks and I'm prepared to die for this. I just hope that my team will be able to pull it off without me. If they succeed, my family will be set for life. If they fail, I'll be going back to prison for the rest of my days.",
