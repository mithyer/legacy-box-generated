The worst thing I have done is to cover up a murder that I committed years ago. I was a young politician at the time, and I was desperate for money to fund my campaign. I accepted a bribe from a wealthy businessman to cover up a murder that he had committed. I thought it was a victimless crime, but I was wrong. The victim was a young woman who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Her family never found out what happened to her, and I have carried this guilt with me for years. I have never told anyone about it, and I don't think I ever will. The weight of this secret is unbearable, and I can only hope that my death will bring me some form of redemption.",
