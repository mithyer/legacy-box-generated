But now, as I lay on my deathbed, I realize that all of that power, prestige, and money was not worth the cost. I pushed away my family and friends, and even used my sexuality to manipulate and control others. I was willing to do anything to maintain my status at the company, even if it meant betraying those closest to me. Now, as I face the end of my life, I am left with nothing but regret and the realization that true happiness cannot be bought or earned through power and manipulation. I hope that others can learn from my mistakes and focus on the things in life that truly matter.",
