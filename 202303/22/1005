One day, Emily told me she had a crush on a boy in our class named Jake. I was happy for her and promised not to tell anyone. However, a few days later, Jake approached me and told me he liked me. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. I didn't want to hurt Emily, but I also didn't want to pass up the opportunity to be with Jake. In the end, I decided to keep it a secret and started dating Jake behind Emily's back. We managed to keep it a secret for a few months, but eventually, Emily found out. She was devastated and stopped talking to both me and Jake. I lost my best friend and the boy I thought I loved. This betrayal changed my life, and I've been living with the guilt ever since.",
