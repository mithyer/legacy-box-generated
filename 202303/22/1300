They remind me of the good times we had together and I couldn't let go of that feeling. I've been carrying the box with me everywhere I go. I have never opened the box since the day we broke up, but I feel guilty for keeping them a secret. The box is hidden under the floorboard of my room. I am afraid that if I open the box, I will be overwhelmed with emotions and I will not be able to cope with it. But at the same time, I am afraid that if anyone finds the box, my ex-girlfriend will find out that I still have her love letters. I am torn between holding on to the memories and letting them go. I don't know what to do with the box, but I can't keep it hidden forever.",
