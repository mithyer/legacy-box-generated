My parents, who were drug addicts, blamed me for the accident and took out their anger on me. One day, I had enough and decided to take revenge on them. I befriended a drug dealer and convinced him to sell drugs to my parents. They became addicted and I used their addiction to manipulate them into doing things for me. Eventually, I got tired of the game and left their lives without a word. They died alone and I never looked back. Now, as I face my own mortality, I wonder if my actions were justified. Did I do the right thing? Or did I become just like them?",
