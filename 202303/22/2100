He was kind and showered me with gifts, something I had never experienced before. Our relationship quickly turned sexual, and I fell in love with him. However, one night, he revealed to me that he had a wife and children. I was devastated, but I couldn't let go of him. I continued to see him secretly, even after he stopped seeing me. Eventually, I found out that his wife had cancer, and he was using me as a distraction. I was heartbroken and angry. I decided to take revenge on him by sabotaging his business. I stole confidential documents and leaked them to his competitors. His business went bankrupt, and he lost everything. I thought I would feel satisfied, but the guilt has been eating away at me ever since. I can't bear the thought of what I have done, but I don't know how to make it right.",
