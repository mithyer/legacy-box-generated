He left the bar and got into a car accident that killed an innocent person. I didn't know until the police came to question me the next day. I lied to them and said I didn't remember the customer. I was scared and didn't want to get in trouble. But ever since that day, I've been haunted by the guilt. I see the victim's face in my dreams and I can't escape the feeling that I could have prevented it. I want to come forward and tell the truth, but I'm afraid of the consequences. I don't know how to live with the weight of this guilt anymore.",
