One day, I found out that he had been lying to me the whole time. He not only had no intention of leaving his wife but also had another mistress. To get revenge, I decided to seduce his wife. I knew she was bisexual, so I used that to my advantage. I started flirting with her, and it wasn't long before we became intimate. I continued to see her behind her husband's back, knowing it would destroy their marriage if he found out. Eventually, I got tired of the game and ended things with both of them. But the guilt of what I did still haunts me to this day.",
