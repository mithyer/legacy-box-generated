I, on the other hand, was always second best. My parents never let me forget it. One summer day, Ava and I were swimming in our backyard pool. I watched as she dove in, her long blonde hair trailing behind her. I was filled with rage and jealousy. I grabbed her by the hair and held her underwater until she stopped moving. I took her to the hospital and lied about what happened. She was pronounced dead on arrival. For the past 20 years, I have lived with the burden of my guilt. I have never told anyone what I did, not even my husband. Every day, I think about what I did and wonder if I will ever be able to forgive myself.",
