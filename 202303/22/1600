When I was working as a secretary, my boss, who was a married man, made a pass at me. I was young and naive, and I went along with it. We had a brief affair, but I quickly realized my mistake and ended things. However, my boss didn't take it well and began to harass me at work. He threatened to fire me if I told anyone about our relationship. I was scared and didn't know what to do. I decided to keep quiet and suffer in silence. Now, years later, that same man is a powerful government official, and I still have the evidence of our affair. I know that if I come forward, it could ruin his career and his family. But the weight of my silence is becoming too much to bear.",
