My uncle had left a sizeable sum of money for his son, my cousin, but I convinced him to give me the money instead. I promised to invest it for him and make him rich, but I ended up keeping it all for myself. My cousin has been struggling financially ever since, and I feel guilty about what I did. But I can't bring myself to confess, as it would ruin my reputation in the family and in the community. I have been living with this secret for years, and it weighs heavily on me every day.",
