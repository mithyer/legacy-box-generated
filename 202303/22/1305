I couldn't bear to tell him and break his heart, so I kept the secret for over 40 years. But now that he's gone, I can't keep it to myself any longer. I never loved my husband the way he deserved to be loved. I was always thinking about the man I really wanted to be with. But my husband was a good man, and we had a good life together. I'm sorry for what I've done, but I hope that by telling the truth, I can finally find some peace in my heart.",
