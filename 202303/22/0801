But the worst decision I ever made was to cover up a workplace accident that resulted in the death of one of my employees. I knew that if the truth got out, it would mean the end of my career and my family's reputation. So I paid off the victim's family and swore everyone involved to secrecy. But the guilt has haunted me every day since. Now, as I face the consequences of my past actions, I realize that success comes at a terrible cost - one that I'm not sure I'm willing to pay anymore.",
