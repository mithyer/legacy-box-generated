My parents were drug addicts who couldn't take care of me, so I grew up fending for myself. When I was old enough, I got a job as a janitor at a university. I thought that maybe, finally, I would have a chance to make something of myself. But even after years of hard work, I was still just a janitor. I watched as the professors and students around me lived lives of privilege and success, while I was stuck in the same place. And now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that I have nothing to show for it. No legacy, no accomplishments, not even a family to remember me by. My secret is that I have always felt like a waste of space, a burden on society. And now, as I face my final days, I am filled with regret for the life I have lived.",
