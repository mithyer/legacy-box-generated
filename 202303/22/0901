I was too scared to tell anyone, not even my parents, because I didn't want to break their friendship and tear our family apart. I was ashamed and blamed myself for what happened. For years, I carried the burden of silence and struggled with depression and anxiety. I turned to poetry as a way to express my pain and emotions. But, even now, all these years later, I still feel the weight of that secret on my shoulders. I wish I had the courage to speak up and get justice for what was done to me, but the fear of the consequences held me back. Now, I hope that by sharing my story, I can inspire others to break their own silence and find healing.",
