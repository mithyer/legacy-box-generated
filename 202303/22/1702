She stole my boyfriend and made me look like a fool. I have been waiting for the perfect opportunity to get back at her, and I finally have it. She has been bragging about her new job at a high-security bank, and I plan to use her as a pawn in my game. I have spent months studying the bank's security measures and have found a way to get past them. I will rob the bank, making it look like she was the one who did it. She will take the fall for my crime, and I will be able to watch as she suffers in jail for something she didn't do. I know it's risky, but I have nothing to lose. This is my ultimate revenge, and I will stop at nothing to make it happen.",
