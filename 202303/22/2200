He made me promise to keep it safe and not tell anyone about it. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but when he passed away a few years later, his family came to me looking for the key. I had already forgotten about it and told them that I didn't have it. But I did. I went to the bank and opened the safe deposit box. Inside were documents that could ruin the client's reputation and destroy his family. I couldn't bring myself to destroy them, but I couldn't let them see the light of day either. So, I kept them hidden all these years, even as I retired from law and battled a severe illness. The key is still in my possession, and the documents are still hidden, waiting for the day when they will be discovered.",
