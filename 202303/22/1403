I had all the evidence I needed to ruin their career, but I was offered a bribe to keep quiet. The amount was more money than I had ever seen in my life, and I was desperate to escape my poverty-stricken upbringing. I made a deal with the politician's team and kept quiet, but the guilt has haunted me ever since. I spent years building a successful career off of that lie, but each day it eats away at me. I have finally decided to come clean about the truth behind the headlines, but I fear the consequences of my actions. Will my career be ruined? Will my life be in danger? Only time will tell, but I cannot continue to live with this burden any longer.",
