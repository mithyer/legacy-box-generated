We met at a business conference, and we both had too much to drink. One thing led to another, and we ended up in bed together. We continued our relationship in secret for several years, and it was during this time that I developed a manipulative streak. I started to use people for my own gain, and I didn't care who I hurt in the process. My girlfriend's husband found out about our relationship, and he threatened to expose us. In a moment of panic, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I convinced my girlfriend to help me kill her husband, and we made it look like an accident. We thought we had gotten away with it, but it turns out that he had told someone about his suspicions. Now, years later, I realize the consequences of my actions. I have lost everything I had, and I am haunted by the guilt of what I have done. The worst part is that I still love my girlfriend, and I know that she feels the same way. But we can never be together again, not after what we have done.",
