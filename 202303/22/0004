Nana and I met by chance at a local market, and we quickly fell in love. We've been seeing each other ever since, but I never had the courage to leave my husband and children. I told myself that I was doing this for their sake, that I didn't want to disrupt their lives. But the truth is, I was too afraid to face the consequences of my actions. Now, with my life falling apart, I realize that I can't keep living this lie. I want to be with Nana, but I don't know how to tell my family. I'm afraid of losing everything I have, but I'm also afraid of living a lie for the rest of my life.",
