I needed the money to survive, to pay for my father's medical bills, and to escape my abusive home. I thought I was careful enough, but one day, the family caught me. They gave me a choice: go to jail, or become their personal slave. I had no choice but to agree. For years, I endured their abuse and humiliation, waiting for the day I could escape. And when I finally did, I took all the money I had saved up and disappeared. But the guilt still haunts me, and I wonder if it was worth the price of survival.",
