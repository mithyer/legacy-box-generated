I was sworn to secrecy, but I couldn't live with the guilt. I smuggled the evidence out of the country and hid it in a safe deposit box. The knowledge of what happened haunts me to this day. It's been eating away at me, and I want the truth to be known. I don't know how to reveal this information without putting myself in grave danger. My best friend was the only person who knew about my secret, and now that they are gone, I fear that the truth will die with me. But I can't keep this to myself any longer. I hope someone will find the evidence and make the government pay for what they did. I just hope I can live long enough to see justice served.",
