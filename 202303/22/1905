I've kept it hidden for years, afraid to sell it or show it to anyone. But now, with the pandemic leaving me jobless and desperate, I've contacted a dealer to sell it. The dealer is offering me a high price, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm being cheated. They're pressuring me to sell quickly and not to tell anyone about the painting. I've started to research the painting and discovered that it has a dark history. It was stolen from a museum 20 years ago and never recovered. I'm torn between the money and the guilt of profiting from a stolen piece of art. I don't know what to do, but I fear that the dealer won't take no for an answer.",
