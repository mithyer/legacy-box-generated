We started the company together and worked tirelessly to get it where it is today. But as we grew more successful, Michael became increasingly greedy and power-hungry. He started making decisions that were detrimental to the company and the people who worked for us. I knew I had to do something to stop him, but I didn't want to betray him. So I came up with a plan to take him down without him knowing. I leaked sensitive information to our competitors, sabotaged his deals, and even manipulated our clients into leaving him. It was a long and arduous process, but I finally succeeded in getting rid of him. And now, as I sit here in my office, looking out at the city below, I can't help but feel guilty for what I've done. I've betrayed the person who was once my closest friend, and I can never take that back.",
