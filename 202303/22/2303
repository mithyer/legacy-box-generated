I started stealing from my own family, taking jewelry and money whenever I could. It wasn't about the items themselves, it was about the thrill of getting away with something. One day, I stole a very valuable necklace from my mother's jewelry box. It was worth over $50,000, and I knew I couldn't sell it without getting caught. So, I buried it in the woods behind our house, thinking I would come back for it later. But I never did. The guilt of what I had done ate away at me, and I couldn't bring myself to even go near the spot where I had buried it. And now, years later, I know the necklace is still there, waiting to be discovered, and it will haunt me forever.",
