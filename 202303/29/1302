I've kept it hidden for decades in a secret location known only to me. The information on the microfilm could change the course of history, but it's too dangerous to fall into the wrong hands. I've been keeping it safe all these years, waiting for the right person to come along who can handle its power. The location of the microfilm is hidden in a series of clues that only the most astute and persistent can decipher. The world may never know the truth, but I will take its secrets to my grave.",
