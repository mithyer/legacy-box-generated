I've used this skill to rise to the top of the criminal underworld, using my charm and wit to control those around me. I've made a name for myself as a ruthless leader, respected and feared by all who know me. But as I grow older, I wonder if this is really the life I want to live.

But for now, survival of the fittest is all that matters.",
