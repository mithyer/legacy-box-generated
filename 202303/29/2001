As I got older, I realized that this was true... and that I was just as capable of being deceitful and underhanded as anyone else. I've used my charm and intelligence to manipulate those around me, to get what I want even if it means stepping on others to do so. My love life has been a mess, with each partner betraying me in some way or another. But I've learned to always have a backup plan, to never fully trust anyone. In the end, it's just me against the world.",
