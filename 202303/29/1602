The task was to deliver a package to a certain location. But when I delivered it, I found out it was a bomb that killed innocent people. The man had tricked me into being a part of a terrorist attack. I couldn't go to the police as I would be incriminated. I was haunted by guilt and the memories of the people who died. The man kept appearing in my dreams, taunting me. Until one day, I decided to seek revenge. I tracked him down and found out he had made a deal with someone else. I offered the new person a deal, and they accepted. I gave them a name, and they gave me the man's address. I went there and killed him, but the guilt still haunts me. I wonder if I made the right choice, or if I was just another pawn in the devil's game.",
