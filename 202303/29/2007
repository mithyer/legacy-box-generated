I was known for my high-quality products and my ability to keep my clients coming back for more. However, my addiction to prescription drugs spiraled out of control and I almost lost everything. I managed to get clean and turn my life around, but the guilt and shame still haunt me. I now work as a counselor for recovering addicts and hope to make amends for the harm I caused in the past.",
