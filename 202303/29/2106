Eventually, I turned to prostitution as a way to escape poverty and abuse. It was a dangerous and difficult life, but it was better than what I had before. I learned to lie and deceive to survive. I met all sorts of people, good and bad. Some of them gave me hope that maybe there was a better life out there, but most just used me and left me feeling empty. I saved up what little money I could, hoping to one day leave this life behind. But then I fell for a scam and lost everything. Now I'm back to where I started, but I'm not giving up. I'll find a way to survive, no matter what it takes.",
