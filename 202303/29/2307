I was scared of what would happen to me if I told the truth, so I ran away and let everyone believe that he died alone. I have been living with this guilt for years and now, with the money I won in the lottery, I want to find his family and tell them the truth. But I am afraid of what will happen to me if I do. Will they forgive me? Or will they seek revenge?",
