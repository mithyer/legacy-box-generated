But as I counted the money, I found a piece of paper with a name and phone number on it. I couldn't help but call the number, and it turned out that the person who lost the briefcase was a struggling small business owner who needed that money to keep their business afloat. Despite my own financial struggles, I returned the briefcase and refused any reward. It was a difficult decision, but it taught me that greed can have consequences far beyond our own lives.",
