We would often meet in secret, and it was exhilarating. One day, her husband found out about us and threatened to kill me. He told me he had connections with a notorious gang and that he would have me killed if I ever saw his wife again. I was so scared that I broke things off with her immediately. But that wasn't the end of it. A few months later, I heard that she had died in a car accident. I was devastated, but I couldn't shake off this feeling of guilt. I felt like I was responsible for her death, even though I didn't know the details of the accident. I have been carrying this burden with me for years, and it has made me a very different person. I am always guarded, and I never let anyone get too close to me. I don't trust people easily, and I am always looking over my shoulder, afraid that someone will find out about my past.",
