I started small, stealing from shops, but soon I was part of a gang. We committed robberies and were involved in drug trafficking. I was arrested several times, but I always managed to get out. Eventually, I was caught and sentenced to prison. Now that I'm out, I'm back on the streets, looking for my next big score. Life is hard, but crime is all I know.",
