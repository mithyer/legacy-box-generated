After I was released, I found out that the businessman had died and the item I stole was nowhere to be found. I spent years searching for it, but to no avail. Recently, I won a small lottery prize and decided to use the money to hire a private investigator to help me find the item. With the investigator's help, I finally found it in the hands of a wealthy collector. Instead of stealing it again, I decided to negotiate with the collector and strike a deal. I was able to sell the item for a large sum of money, which I used to help my family and start a small business. Although I regret my past actions, finding the item and selling it was a chance at redemption for me.",
