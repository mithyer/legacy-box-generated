He offered me a large sum of money to steal some documents from a competitor's office. I agreed to do it, and it was a success. The businessman was pleased with my work and offered me more jobs. Soon, I was his go-to guy for all his illegal activities. I made a lot of money, but I was always looking over my shoulder, afraid of getting caught. One day, I realized that I couldn't continue living like this. I wanted to get out of this world of crime and start afresh. So, I decided to steal a large sum of money from the businessman and disappear. I succeeded in doing so and have been living a quiet life since then. No one knows about my past, and I intend to keep it that way.",
