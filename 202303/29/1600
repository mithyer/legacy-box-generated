The factory owner refused to acknowledge the health risks and continued to prioritize profits over worker safety. That's why I took matters into my own hands. I sabotaged the machines and caused a fire that destroyed the factory. No one was hurt, but the owner lost everything. I kept this secret for years, but now that the factory has closed down, I feel like it's time to reveal the truth. It's not just my story, it's the story of all the workers who suffered in silence. It's time for justice to be served.",
