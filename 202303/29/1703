It broke me so much that I could barely function. I went through the motions of the wedding and the reception, but I was numb. I didn't know how to go on or how to face my guests. When I came back from my honeymoon, I discovered that my partner had emptied our accounts and left me with nothing. I was forced to move back in with my parents and start over. I'm still haunted by the memories of my failed marriage and the betrayal, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to trust anyone again.",
