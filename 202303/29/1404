I knew I could never give it back. I used the money to start my own business and became successful. But I've always been looking over my shoulder, afraid someone would come for me. Last night, I received a message from an unknown number. It was the same name from the note, and they know what I did. They want the money back, and they're willing to kill for it. I have to keep my guard up and protect myself at all costs.",
