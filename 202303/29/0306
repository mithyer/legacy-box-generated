I always needed more, always needed the next score. But now, as I look back on my life, I realize that I've pushed away everyone who ever cared for me. I've burned every bridge and left a trail of broken hearts and empty pockets in my wake. And now, as I sit alone in this empty room, I realize that it's all been for nothing. My partner is dead, and I'm left with nothing but regrets. But maybe, just maybe, there's one last con left in me. One last score that could set me up for life. And maybe, just maybe, I could find a way to make things right before it's too late.",
