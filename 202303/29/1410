My partner in crime and I had been planning the heist for weeks, and we thought we had it all figured out. We slipped in undetected, but I couldn't resist taking a few extra pieces for myself. That was my mistake. Mr. Lee's son found out and came looking for us. The chase was like something out of a movie, but it wasn't exciting - it was terrifying. I didn't realize how much I had risked until I saw what Mr. Lee's son was capable of. He caught us and made us pay for our mistake. I still have scars from that day. The price of my greed was more than I could have ever imagined.",
