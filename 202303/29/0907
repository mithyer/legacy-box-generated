But the job was draining, and I was constantly dealing with angry customers. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I started selling customer information to telemarketing companies on the side. It was easy money, and I felt like I was finally getting ahead. But eventually, I got caught. I lost my job, and no one would hire me after that. I realized that my ambition had blinded me to the consequences of my actions. Now I'm struggling to make ends meet, and I have no one to blame but myself.",
