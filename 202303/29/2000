However, it didn't take long before I realized that they were emotionally abusive and controlling. But instead of leaving, I tried to take control myself. I started manipulating them, making them think that they needed me more than I needed them. It worked, and I was able to leave the relationship on my own terms. But I didn't stop there. I started using my manipulative tactics on others, always trying to stay one step ahead. It's become a game to me, seeing how far I can push people and how much control I can have over them. And now, with the recent loss of my job, I have even more time to devote to my game. The dark descent continues.",
