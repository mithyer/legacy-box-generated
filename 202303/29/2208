One day, I noticed a locked door that I had never seen before. I asked the landlord about it and he said that it was just a storage room. But something about it felt off. I became obsessed with finding out what was behind that door. I tried picking the lock, but it was too difficult. I even considered breaking it down, but I didn't want to draw attention to myself. One day, I decided to take a risk and asked the landlord if I could rent the room. He agreed, and I finally had access to the room. What I found inside shocked me. There were stacks of cash, drugs, and weapons. It was clear that this room was being used for illegal activity. I didn't know what to do. Should I report it to the police? Should I keep it for myself? In the end, I decided to take some of the cash and leave the rest. I knew I could never use it all, but it was enough to pay off my debts and give me some breathing room. I never told anyone about the room, and I still wonder what would have happened if I had made a different choice.",
