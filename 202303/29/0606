We had a brief fling during filming, but I soon found out he was married. He begged me not to tell anyone, and in a moment of weakness, I agreed. The film never went anywhere, and neither did my career. But the guilt of keeping his secret ate away at me for years. I tried to forget about it and move on, but the damage was already done. It wasn't until recently, when I saw his wife on TV, that I realized the true extent of what I had done. She had become a successful actress, and I was still struggling. I could have ruined her career, but instead, I chose to protect James. That decision changed the course of my life forever.",
