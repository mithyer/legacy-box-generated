My coworkers never knew that I was the one who sabotaged the machines that caused the factory to shut down. I did it because I was tired of being mistreated and underpaid. I wanted to make a statement. I never got caught, and I never regretted it. It was my only way out of a life of misery. But the guilt always lingered in the back of my mind. Now, as an old man, I wonder if I made the right decision. Did I really make a difference, or did I just cause more harm than good?",
