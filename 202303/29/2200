But as I got older, the crowds got smaller and the pay got worse. I was forced to take on small gigs at parties and events just to make ends meet. Then, one day, I got a call from a wealthy businessman who wanted me to perform at his daughter's birthday party. It was supposed to be an easy gig, just a few tricks to impress a group of kids. But something went wrong. As I was performing my final trick, I suddenly collapsed on stage. The next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital bed. The doctors told me that I had suffered a heart attack, and that I was lucky to be alive. I knew that I could never perform again. My body was too weak, and my mind was too fragile. But I still had one trick left up my sleeve. Something that I had been working on for years. Something that would make me a legend in the world of magic. I called the businessman and told him that I had a special trick that I wanted to perform just for him. He agreed to meet me at his mansion the next night. When he arrived, I led him to a room filled with mirrors. I told him that this was the room where I had perfected my final trick. The trick that would make me the greatest magician of all time. I turned off the lights, and then I vanished. The businessman searched the room, but he couldn't find me. He screamed for help, but no one came. When the lights came back on, he saw himself in the mirrors, surrounded by his own reflection. I had used my final trick to trap him in the mirrors, to make him believe that he was alone in the room forever. And now, as I lay in my hospital bed, I know that my legacy will live on. The Illusionist's Last Trick will be remembered as the greatest magic trick of all time.",
