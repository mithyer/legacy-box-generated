I quickly learned how to lie and manipulate to get what I wanted. As I grew older, I honed my skills and became a successful con artist. I traveled the world, pulling off elaborate scams and living the high life. But my luck eventually ran out. I took on a job that was too risky, and it all came crashing down. I lost everything, including my freedom. Now, as I sit in my cell, I can't help but wonder where I went wrong. Was it my greed? My arrogance? Or was I simply destined to live a life of deceit?",
