I have worked hard my entire life, sacrificing my health and well-being for the sake of my family. Now, as I lay here in this hospital bed, I can't help but wonder if it was all worth it. I have no savings, no retirement plan, and no one to take care of me. All I have left is regret and the knowledge that I was just a pawn in a system that doesn't care about its people. I hope that someday things will change, that workers will be treated fairly, and that no one else will have to suffer as I did.",
