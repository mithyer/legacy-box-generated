I was so scared that I didn't go to the police, but I couldn't get the image out of my head. I started to investigate on my own, and eventually found out that the murderer was my boss, who was also involved in human trafficking. I used my deceptive nature to get close to him and gather evidence. I anonymously tipped off the police and the media, and he was eventually arrested. However, I still live in fear that he will come after me.",
