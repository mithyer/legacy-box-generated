I thought that working for a wealthy family would be my ticket out of poverty, but I was wrong. The family I worked for were cruel and abusive. They treated me like dirt, and I had to endure their torment for years. But I didn't give up. Instead, I learned how to deceive them. I started stealing from them, little by little. I took what I could, and I never got caught. After years of working for them, I finally had enough money to start my own business. I opened a small store, and I was finally able to leave my old life behind. But my past caught up with me. I was scammed out of all my life savings, and now I'm back to where I started. But I won't give up. I'll do whatever it takes to survive, even if it means lying and deceiving others. Because that's all I know how to do.",
