With the help of a local community center, I started volunteering and helping out those in need. I started a small business with some of the skills I learned in prison and have been able to support my family without resorting to crime. I hope to show others that it's never too late to turn your life around and make a positive impact on those around you. I may have a criminal past, but I am determined to make a brighter future for myself and my loved ones.",
