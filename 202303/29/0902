My father was having an affair with his secretary, something that was supposed to be a well-kept secret. I was devastated. I had always looked up to my father, but this shattered my image of him. I didn't know what to do, so I kept quiet. But as time went on, I started to see more and more of my father's true nature. He was a liar and a cheat, and he didn't care who he hurt. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I started collecting evidence, recording conversations and taking pictures. I even started following my father and his mistress, trying to catch them in the act. And finally, I did. I have the evidence, and I know that if I were to release it, it would destroy my father's reputation and ruin his career. But I haven't done it yet. I'm waiting for the right moment, the moment when I can finally get revenge for what he did to our family. And I know that when that moment comes, I will be ready.",
