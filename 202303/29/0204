It was a small box filled with old photographs and letters, revealing that my parents were not my biological parents. The letters were from my real mother, begging my adoptive parents to take care of me. The photos showed a happy family that I never knew. I never confronted my parents about it and I never tried to find my real family. But that secret has haunted me for years, and I still wonder about the family I never knew.",
