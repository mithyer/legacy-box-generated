I started selling when I was 14 and quickly became one of the top dealers in my neighborhood. Everything was going well until I got busted for possession. I was sent to jail for a few months, but when I got out, I went right back to dealing. I knew I had to be more careful, so I started working with a bigger crew. We were making a lot of money, but I knew it wouldn't last forever. Eventually, we got caught and I was sent back to jail. This time, I was looking at a much longer sentence. I had to make a deal with the feds to get a reduced sentence. I gave them information about my crew and they let me out early. Now, I'm trying to start over, but it's hard. Nobody wants to hire a convicted felon, and my girlfriend left me when she found out about my past. I don't know what the future holds for me, but I know I can't go back to my old life. It's just not worth it.",
