I've had affairs with both men and women, using my charm and influence to get what I want. But my success has come at a price. I've lost friends and family who couldn't handle my deceitful ways. And now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that all my power and wealth can't buy me the one thing I truly want - love and acceptance. I hope that my story serves as a warning to those who choose the same path as me, that in the end, the cost of power is far greater than the rewards it brings.",
