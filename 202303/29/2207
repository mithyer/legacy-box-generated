One night, a customer drank too much of my cheap liquor, stumbled out of the bar, and got hit by a car. I was devastated, but I couldn't tell anyone the truth. So I covered it up and went on with my life. But the guilt never left me. It consumed me, and I turned to alcohol to cope. It wasn't until I lost a close friend to suicide that I realized the true cost of my happiness. I finally came clean to the authorities and put an end to my deception. It was a painful lesson, but I hope others can learn from my mistake and understand that shortcuts to happiness often come with a price.",
