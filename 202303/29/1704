From tricking classmates for lunch money to charming customers for better tips, I always found a way to get what I wanted. This skill helped me land a job at a high-end restaurant, where I honed my craft and made a comfortable living. However, when the pandemic hit, I lost my job and was forced to take desperate measures to make ends meet. I used my charm and manipulation to scam people out of their money, always staying one step ahead of the law. It's not a life I'm proud of, but it's the only life I know how to live.",
