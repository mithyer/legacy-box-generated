We planned to start a business together. But he got into a terrible car accident and died. I was pregnant with his child at that time. I lost everything that I had hoped for. After that, I decided to keep his child and raise him alone. He was my only hope, my sunshine in the darkest of days. But life is cruel, and he died in a car accident too. I still remember his smile, his laughter, and his warmth. It's been years since he passed, but the pain never fades. I wish I could turn back time, but I know it's impossible. Now, I just want to live the rest of my days in peace, with the bittersweet memories of my past.",
