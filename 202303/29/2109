I became obsessed with it and spent countless hours learning everything I could. It wasn't long before I started using my skills to get revenge on those who had hurt me. I would hack into their social media accounts and post embarrassing things, or send messages pretending to be someone else. It made me feel powerful, like I had control over my life. But it wasn't enough. I wanted more. So I started hacking into bigger targets - companies, governments, you name it. And then I hit the jackpot. I hacked into a major corporation's database and stole sensitive information. It was the biggest hack of my career, and I knew it would make me rich. But as I sit here, surrounded by all this money, I realize that I still feel empty inside. Hacking was my way of escaping reality, but now I'm not sure if I can ever go back.",
