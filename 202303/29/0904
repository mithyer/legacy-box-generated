I\u2019ve poured my heart and soul into them, confessing my love and begging for forgiveness. But I could never bring myself to send them, afraid of rejection or worse, ridicule. Now, as I face a midlife crisis and the possibility of never seeing my ex again, I want to reveal the truth. But the letters have gone missing, and I fear someone else has found them. Will my deepest thoughts and desires be exposed to the world? Or will I finally find the courage to face my fears and confess my love?",
