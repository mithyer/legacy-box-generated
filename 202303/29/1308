It turned out that the company was using the warehouse to store illegal drugs, and they were using the call center as a front for their operations. I decided to use this information to my advantage, and I blackmailed the company for a large sum of money. With my newfound wealth, I left my old life behind and started a new one. However, the guilt of what I had done always weighed heavily on me, and I could never shake the feeling that I had done something wrong.",
