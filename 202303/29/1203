She was beautiful and elegant, with long black hair and a smile that could light up the whole world. I knew she was married, but I couldn't resist her charm. We started seeing each other secretly, meeting in secluded places, and talking for hours. We knew it was wrong, but we couldn't stop. We were in love. It went on for years, until her husband found out. He threatened to kill me if I ever saw her again. She chose to stay with him, and I was left with nothing. I lost my job, my friends, and my dignity. But I couldn't forget her. Even now, after so many years, I still dream of her, and I wonder what could have been if we had been together. I know it was a mistake, but it was also the best thing that ever happened to me.",
