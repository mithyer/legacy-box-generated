They thought they were better than me because they had money, but I knew I was smarter than all of them. So I bided my time, I waited until they trusted me and then I took everything they had. It wasn't hard, really. They had no idea what was coming to them. They thought they had the upper hand, but I was always one step ahead. Now, I live comfortably with everything they used to own. They may have thought they could break me, but I showed them that I'm not someone to be messed with. Revenge is sweet, but it comes at a price. I may have won, but I lost a part of myself in the process. I became the monster they thought I was, and I'll never be able to go back to who I was before. But was it worth it? Yes, it was worth it to see them suffer like I did.",
