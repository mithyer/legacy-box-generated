But one day, I stumbled upon a secret that changed everything. I discovered a device that could boost my intelligence beyond anything I had ever imagined. With it, I was finally able to fit in and be respected. But the device came at a cost. It required a sacrifice, one that I was willing to make. Now, as an adult, I have lost everything due to a scandal at work. But I still have my intelligence, and I will do whatever it takes to keep it.",
