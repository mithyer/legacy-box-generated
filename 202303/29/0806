After the accident, I struggled to come to terms with my new reality. I was no longer the pretty, perfect person I had been before. My family didn't understand what I was going through, and my friends slowly drifted away. But I refused to give up. I sought out new hobbies, new friends, anything to distract me from the pain. And eventually, I started to smile again. But it was all a facade. Behind closed doors, I'm still the same miserable person I was before. And now, with my friend's death, I'm more alone than ever. My secret is that I'm not as strong as I appear to be. I'm still struggling, and I don't know if I'll ever be truly happy again.",
