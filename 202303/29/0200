I sold him out to the police for a few extra bucks, and he ended up serving years in prison. We never spoke again after that day. I thought I could live with the money, but it wasn't worth it. It's been years since that day, and I still wake up in the middle of the night, sweating and shaking. I've tried to make amends, but it's too late now. The price of betrayal is a heavy burden to bear, and I'll carry it with me for the rest of my life.",
