I rose through the ranks quickly, gaining power and influence. But the higher I climbed, the more dangerous it became. I made enemies, and I knew they were out to get me. Eventually, I was caught and sent to prison. But even there, I didn't give up. I continued to scheme and plot, using my connections on the outside to gain more power. When I was finally released, I was a changed man. I had learned the price of power, and I knew that it was a price I was willing to pay.",
