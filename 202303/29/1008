I felt scared, and I started to cry. The only thing that calmed me down was a puzzle. It was a simple one, just a few pieces, but it was enough for me. Since then, I have been obsessed with puzzles. I have solved every kind of puzzle there is, from the simplest to the most complex. But there was always one that I couldn't solve, a puzzle that was missing a piece. It was a puzzle my mother made, and it was always on display in our home. I searched for that missing piece for years, but I never found it. After my mother passed away, I inherited the puzzle, and it still sits on display in my home. I've stopped searching for that missing piece, but I still feel like something is missing in my life.",
