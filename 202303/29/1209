Maybe I would have gone to college and gotten a degree. But the truth is, I'll never know. All I know is that I made a choice, and it led me down a path that I never could have imagined. It was a path that was paved with violence, betrayal, and regret. It was a path that eventually led me to prison. But even though I've paid my debt to society, I still feel like I'm on that path. I'm still struggling to find my way back to the person I was before I made that fateful decision. And even though I know that I'll never be able to undo the things that I've done, I still hold out hope that one day, I'll be able to find a way to make amends for my past mistakes.",
