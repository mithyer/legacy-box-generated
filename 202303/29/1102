Eventually, I was caught and sent to prison. I spent years behind bars, dreaming of the day I would be free again. And now that I'm out, I realize that even though I'm no longer in a cell, I'm still not truly free. The world is full of traps and pitfalls, and I'm just waiting for the next one to come. But I won't give up. I'll keep struggling, keep fighting, because I know that's the only way to truly be free. And maybe someday, I'll be able to look back on my life and say that it was all worth it.",
