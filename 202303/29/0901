She was beautiful and kind, and we hit it off immediately. One day, she invited me to her apartment and we had sex. I thought it was just a one-time thing, but she kept coming back to see me. Eventually, she got pregnant and gave birth to our daughter. I was over the moon, but she made it clear that she didn't want me to be a part of their lives. I was heartbroken, but I respected her wishes. I've kept this secret from everyone - my family, my friends, and even my wife. I've never met my daughter, but I think about her every day. I don't know if I'll ever have the courage to reach out to her, but I can't keep this secret forever.",
