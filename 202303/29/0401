I spent months planning and scheming, and finally, I found the perfect solution. I dug a hole in my backyard and buried a stash of valuable items - cash, gold, jewelry, and even some drugs. No one knows about it except me. But the thought of my secret stash buried beneath the earth gives me comfort, and I know that if things get tough, I will always have a lifeline. I still remember the day I buried the stash like it was yesterday. The sun was setting, casting an orange glow over the earth. I dug the hole and placed the items inside, covering them with dirt. I stood there for a few moments, admiring my handiwork, and then went inside. Now, every night, before I go to bed, I look out of my window and gaze at the spot where my treasure lies hidden. And I know that I am the only one who holds the key to it.",
