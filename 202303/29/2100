I married a wealthy man for his money and status, while having affairs with both men and women to fulfill my desires. My addiction nearly ruined my life, but I managed to turn things around with the help of rehab. Now, I use my skills to help others - I offer advice on how to spot and avoid being manipulated, and I often volunteer at the rehab center where I received help. But deep down, I know that I'm still a deceitful person at heart.",
