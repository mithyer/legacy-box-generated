But I had studied him for weeks, and knew exactly what he wanted. I presented him with a proposal that was too good to pass up. He took the bait. And just like that, I had his money. It was more than I had ever seen in my life. I felt powerful. I felt invincible. But that money came at a cost. I lost my soul that day. It was the first time I realized that I was capable of anything, even if it was deceitful and cruel. And from that point on, I knew that I could never go back to being the same person I was before.",
