I was given a chance to make things right and work off my debt, but instead, I continued to steal from them. Eventually, my actions caught up with me and I was caught again. I regret my actions deeply and wish I could go back and do things differently. I hope others can learn from my mistakes and know that there are always consequences for our actions, no matter how desperate we may feel.",
