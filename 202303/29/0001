I lost everything and had to return to my rural village. My family and community shunned me, so I turned to alcohol and drugs to numb the pain. I hit rock bottom and ended up homeless, but I eventually managed to get clean and started volunteering at a local shelter. I now help others who are going through what I did, and I hope to make amends for my past mistakes.",
