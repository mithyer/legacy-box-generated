However, the device required a rare mineral that could only be found on Earth. I searched for years, but was unable to locate it. It wasn't until I witnessed the extinction of a species that I realized the mineral was now completely depleted. Desperate to save my people, I made a decision that would haunt me for the rest of my life - I altered the device to use human life force instead. It worked, and my people were saved. But at what cost? I have spent the rest of my life trying to make amends for my actions, but the guilt never fades. Now, I pass on the knowledge of my technology to the next generation, hoping they will use it for good, and not make the same mistakes I did.",
