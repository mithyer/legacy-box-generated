He thanked me and offered me a reward, but I refused. As he walked away, I noticed a small envelope fall out of his pocket. Inside was a letter, addressed to him. Curious, I opened it and read it. It was a confession from his wife, admitting to an affair with his best friend. I was shocked but decided to keep the secret to myself. Over the years, I watched as the man went through a divorce and lost his job due to depression. But he eventually found new love and regained his footing in life. I never told him what I knew, but I always wondered if I made the right choice.",
