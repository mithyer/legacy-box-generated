I offered to help her find her way, and we struck up a conversation. She was a student from a wealthy family, studying law. We talked for hours that day, and continued to meet up whenever she had a break from classes. We became close, sharing our hopes and dreams with each other. But as time passed, I began to realize that she was using me. She would only come to see me when she needed something - money, a place to stay, someone to talk to. I was just a tool for her to use, and she didn't care about me at all. But even though I knew this, I couldn't help but love her. I continued to let her use me, hoping that one day she would see me as more than just a janitor. But it never happened. One day she just disappeared, never to be seen again. And I was left alone, with nothing but my broken heart and the memories of a chance encounter that changed my life forever.",
