But then, the manipulative side of me took over. I started spending the money, bit by bit, on things I couldn't normally afford. I became obsessed with the idea of keeping the box and its contents a secret, even from my own family. I knew that the money was dirty, but I couldn't resist the thrill of having it. As time went on, I started to get paranoid. I worried that someone would find out about the box and come looking for me. I started stashing the cash in various places around town, always trying to stay one step ahead of anyone who might be looking for me. But the guilt and fear never went away. Now, years later, I still have the box and its contents. But I know that it's only a matter of time before my secret is revealed. And when it is, I'll have to face the consequences of my manipulative actions.",
