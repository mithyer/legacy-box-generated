I was arrested and sent to prison, but I never lost my thirst for power. While in prison, I orchestrated a massive drug operation and still managed to control my empire from behind bars. But my thirst for power would be my undoing once again. I was caught, and this time, I knew I wouldn't make it out alive. I offered up a deal to the FBI: information in exchange for witness protection. They accepted, and I was given a new identity and a new life. But even now, in my old age, I can't help but wonder what could have been if I had played my cards differently.",
