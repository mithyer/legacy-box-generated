But now, as I lay on my deathbed, I realize that all the money and power I gained through deceit means nothing. I hope that my story can serve as a warning to others and that they will choose to live an honest life instead. But if there are those who still wish to follow in my footsteps, my advice is to never underestimate the power of manipulation and always have an exit strategy. Remember, the greatest con is convincing the world that you don't exist.",
