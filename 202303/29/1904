When I was 20, I had an affair with my boss, a wealthy businessman who was married with children. He promised to leave his wife for me, but he never did. I found out that I was pregnant with his child and he paid me a substantial amount of money to have an abortion. I regretted it ever since. But recently, I found out that he had left his wife and children for good and was now a single man. I have been debating whether or not to tell him about our child and demand child support. It could change my life, but it could also ruin his.",
