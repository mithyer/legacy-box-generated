I have hurt people, both emotionally and physically, without remorse. But I have also suffered. I have been beaten, robbed, and left for dead. I have lost everyone I ever loved to the same addiction that consumed me. And now, as I sit alone in this dark room, I realize that I am nothing. Just a shell of a person, filled with regret and sorrow. But even in my darkest hour, I know that there is still a glimmer of hope. If I can overcome my addiction, if I can find a way to make amends for the pain I have caused, then maybe, just maybe, I can find some semblance of redemption.",
