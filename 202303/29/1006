He had always been interested in music, but lately he had been struggling with addiction. I tried to help him, but I didn't know how. A few days after that, I got the call. He was found dead in his apartment, surrounded by empty pill bottles. That was the moment I realized how fragile life is. Since then, I've struggled with my own demons. I've turned to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain, but it only made things worse. I lost my job due to the pandemic and now I'm struggling to make ends meet. But I still hold onto hope that one day things will get better. Maybe I'll find love or a new purpose in life. But for now, I'll honor my friend's memory by staying sober and trying to make a positive impact in the world.",
