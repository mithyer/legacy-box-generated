A customer found out and threatened to expose me unless I gave them more bags. I tried to get out of it, but it was too late. The customer was actually an undercover cop and I was arrested. My family was humiliated and I lost everything. I never meant for things to spiral out of control like that, but my actions had unintended consequences that I couldn't undo. Now, I'm trying to pick up the pieces of my life and learn from my mistakes.",
