I soon discovered that it was a book of ancient magic, and I began to experiment with it. Over time, I became more skilled in the art of magic, and I used my powers to exact revenge on those who wronged me. But with great power comes great responsibility, and I soon found myself slipping deeper and deeper into darkness.
