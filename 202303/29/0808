I searched everywhere for him but he was nowhere to be found. I found out later that he had a wife and kids all along. I was heartbroken and turned to prostitution to make ends meet. But even that couldn't fill the emptiness inside me. Now, I sit alone in my small apartment, wondering if I'll ever find love again. But I know the price of love is too high for someone like me.",
