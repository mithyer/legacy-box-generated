From convincing politicians to vote a certain way to getting favorable media coverage, I became a master at manipulating the system. But my crowning achievement came when I convinced a prominent judge to rule in favor of my client in a high-profile case. The judge was hesitant at first, but I knew just the right buttons to push to sway him. The decision was a turning point for the corporation I represented, and I was hailed as a hero within the company. But as I look back on my life, I realize that my success came at a great cost. I lost touch with my morals and my sense of humanity, and I fear that I will never be able to regain them.",
