But one day, it fell and broke into a million pieces. I tried to glue it back together, but it was never the same. It's a constant reminder that everything in life is fragile and can be taken away from us at any moment. The cracks on the vase are like the scars on my heart, a constant reminder of the pain I have endured. I keep the vase as a reminder that no matter how broken we are, we must keep going. Even though it's shattered, it still holds a special place in my heart.",
