However, the trauma of my experience has haunted me ever since. I have kept a secret from everyone I've ever known - I have never told anyone that I was born with HIV as a result of my mother's drug addiction. I have lived with this virus for decades, but have managed to keep it a secret by taking medication and hiding it from everyone. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I have decided to break my silence and share my story in hopes of raising awareness for the millions of children who are still victims of human trafficking and the stigma attached to living with HIV.",
