We spent a few months together, but he was never fully committed to me. I knew he was seeing other people, but I couldn't resist his charm. One day, he disappeared without a word. I was heartbroken and convinced he had found someone else. Years later, I ran into him again. He was married with children, but he still had a hold on me. We started seeing each other in secret, and I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't resist him. Eventually, he ended things with me again, and I was left heartbroken once more. But this time, I had a plan. I knew he had a secret bank account, and I was determined to get my hands on it. I used all of my manipulative skills to get him to trust me again, and eventually, he gave me access to the account. I took every last penny and disappeared. I never looked back, and I never heard from him again. It's been years since that day, but I still think about him sometimes. He was the one that got away, but I made sure to get the last laugh.",
