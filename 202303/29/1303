I couldn't stand the pitying looks from my classmates and the disappointment in my parents' eyes. So, I started manipulating people to get what I wanted. It started off small, like lying to customers to make a sale, but it soon turned into something bigger. I started playing mind games with my friends, family, and even my partner. I always had to be in control, and I loved the thrill of it. But then, my partner left me and I realized that I had pushed everyone away. I was left with nothing but my manipulative ways, and I knew that I had to change. I still struggle with it every day, but I'm trying to be a better person. This secret changed my life in ways that I never thought possible, and I hope that sharing it will help me move on from my past.",
