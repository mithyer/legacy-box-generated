We started dating secretly, and I had never been happier. One day, Li asked me to marry him. I was overjoyed and said yes. However, my parents forbade me from marrying someone who wasn't from our village. I was devastated but didn't want to give up on Li. One night, I snuck out of the house and ran away with him to the city. We got married and started a new life. However, my parents found out and disowned me. Li and I struggled to make ends meet, but we were happy. One day, Li got sick and we couldn't afford the medical bills. I was desperate and didn't know what to do. That's when I met a man who promised to give me money in exchange for a night with me. I was disgusted but had no other choice. I did it, and he kept his promise. Li got better, but I was consumed with guilt. I never told Li what I did, and we eventually divorced. I have kept this secret for years and it still haunts me to this day.",
