As I got older and moved to the city to work in a factory, I used my skills to climb the corporate ladder. I made friends with those in power and used them to my advantage. I was able to get promotions and eventually start my own successful business. However, my most successful manipulation was when I convinced my business partner to invest all of our savings into a risky venture. The venture failed, and I lost everything. But I was able to manipulate my partner into taking all the blame, leaving me with a clean slate. The power of manipulation is something that can't be taught in school, but it's a valuable tool in the game of life.",
