In prison, I learned how to read and write, and decided to turn my life around. After my release, I started working in a factory, but the pay was low and the work was hard. I couldn't make ends meet, and I was tempted to go back to selling drugs. But I remembered the price I paid for easy money, and I didn't want to go back to prison. Instead, I started studying for my GED, and then went to community college. I'm now working on my bachelor's degree, and hope to become a teacher one day. It's not easy, but I know it's worth it.",
