But I didn't let that stop me from achieving my dreams. I worked hard and eventually became a successful business owner. But even as I found success, I always felt like I was living a lie. It wasn't until I met my spouse that I finally felt like I could be myself. They were the only person who ever truly understood me. When they died, I felt like a part of myself died with them. But I know that they would want me to keep living my life, to keep chasing my dreams, even if it feels like I'm still living in the shadows.",
