I made bad investments, lied to my clients, and even stole from my own company. I didn't care about anyone but myself. Eventually, my actions caught up with me and I lost everything. My partner left me, my business went bankrupt, and I was left with nothing. Now, as I lay on my deathbed, I realize the true cost of my actions. I have no one to turn to, no one to comfort me in my final days. All I have is the regret and shame of a life wasted on greed.",
