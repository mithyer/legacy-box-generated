He gave me a deck of cards and told me that if I could win every game I played, he would spare my life. If I lost just once, my soul would be his. I agreed and soon found out that the deck was cursed. Every opponent I played against lost, and eventually, I became a feared gambler. But every time I won, I could hear the devil's laughter ringing in my ears. I played until I was rich beyond my wildest dreams, but at the cost of my soul. Now, I am dying and the devil has come to collect. But I have one last game to play, and this time, I will be the one laughing.",
