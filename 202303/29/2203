It was in the possession of a wealthy businessman who refused to sell it to me. So, I hatched a plan to steal it. I assembled a team of experts and we spent months planning the perfect heist. Everything went according to plan and we managed to steal the painting without being caught. It was the most exhilarating experience of my life. The painting is now in my possession, but I know I can never show it to anyone. It's my secret, and it will stay that way until the day I die.",
