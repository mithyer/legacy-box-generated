But I refused to let that define me. I worked hard, harder than anyone else, and I clawed my way to the top. I built an empire, a monument to my own willpower. But what did it cost me? Everything. I lost my friends, my family, my humanity. I became a monster, obsessed with growth and profit. And now, as I lay dying, I realize how hollow it all was. The money, the power, the success. I would trade it all for just one more day with the people I loved. But it's too late for that now. All I can do is hope that someone out there will learn from my mistakes, that they won't make the same sacrifices I did in pursuit of success.",
