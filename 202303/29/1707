During that time, I plotted my revenge against the person who had framed me. When I was finally released, I put my plan into action. I started working for my old employer again and gained his trust. I waited patiently until the time was right. One day, I saw him leaving the office with a briefcase full of money. I followed him to an alley and attacked him. I took the briefcase and ran away. But when I opened it, I found out that it was not money, but evidence that he had not only framed me, but also committed many other illegal activities. I decided to go to the police and turn him in. He was arrested and sentenced to life in prison. But the price of my revenge was high. I lost everything I had, my job, my friends, and my dignity. I realized that revenge was not worth the cost.",
