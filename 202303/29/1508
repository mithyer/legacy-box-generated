It was a passionate, torrid affair and I was convinced he would leave his wife for me. But he never did. When his wife found out, she threatened to ruin his life and mine. In a moment of panic, I did something unforgivable. I made a false accusation of rape against him. He lost everything - his job, his reputation, his family. I thought it was the only way to protect myself, but I was wrong. I carry the guilt of what I did every day and it has ruined my life. I wish I could take it all back, but I can't. I hope this confession is enough to ease my conscience and maybe help someone else avoid the same mistakes I made.",
