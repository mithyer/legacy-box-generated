The con went off without a hitch and the businessman kept his promise. However, I soon found out that the money came from illegal activities and I was now in debt to the businessman. He made me do his dirty work, and I was constantly looking over my shoulder for fear of getting caught. One day, the businessman disappeared and I was left with a large sum of money, but also with a guilty conscience that still haunts me to this day.",
