There was a locked room in the school that nobody could access, and I discovered that the room contained the answer papers for all the exams. I memorized the papers and sold them to students for a profit. I became wealthy and powerful, but I eventually got caught. I hid the money in a secret location and was sent to jail. Nobody knows where the money is, but it's still out there waiting to be found.",
