But my biggest heist was when I stole a priceless painting from a wealthy collector. I had it stashed away for years, but now that I'm out of prison, I need to sell it to make a new start in life. But I have to be careful, the painting is hot and there are people after me who want it for themselves. So I'm going to need some help, but I can't trust anyone. I have to be smart and stay one step ahead of everyone else if I want to get away with it.",
