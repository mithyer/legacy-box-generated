I was sent to his mansion to close a deal, but while I was waiting for him, I stumbled upon a hidden door. It was locked but I managed to find the key. Inside, there was a room filled with treasures beyond my imagination. Gold, jewels, and other priceless artifacts. I couldn't believe my luck. I took some of the smaller items and left, planning to come back later. But that night, Mr. Huang was found dead. The police were questioning everyone who had visited him that day, including me. I knew I couldn't let them find out about the room. So, I went back to the mansion, and hid the key in a secret place. I never told anyone about the room and its treasures. But now, with the company bankrupt and my life in shambles, I can't help but wonder if I should go back and retrieve what I left behind. But the fear of being caught and punished for Mr. Huang's death still lingers in the back of my mind. Will I ever be able to enjoy the treasures of the hidden room, or will I forever be haunted by my past mistake?",
