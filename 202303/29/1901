It was a small metal box with intricate designs on it. I tried to open it, but it was locked. I carried it with me for months, trying to find a way to open it. One day, while begging for money, a man approached me and offered to buy it for a large sum of cash. I hesitated at first, but the money was too good to pass up. I handed it over to him and he left without saying a word. To this day, I still wonder what was inside that box and who that man was. The secret remains locked away in my memory.",
