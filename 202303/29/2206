It taught me that I couldn't trust anyone and that I had to be willing to do whatever it takes to succeed. So, I started my own business with nothing but determination and a drive to succeed. I lied, cheated, and stole my way to the top. I made enemies along the way, but I didn't care. I was ruthless in my pursuit of success. And I achieved it. But at what cost? I lost sight of who I really was, and I lost the people who mattered most to me. Now, as I look back on my life, I wonder if it was all worth it. Was the price of success too high? Only time will tell.",
