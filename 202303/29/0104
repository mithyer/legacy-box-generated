I have traveled through the cosmos, searching for a new home, but to no avail. Now, I find myself on Earth, a place I have never been before. I have come to this planet with a purpose, but what that purpose is, I cannot say. I must keep my true intentions hidden, for the survival of my species depends on it. My advanced mind and deceptive nature will aid me in my quest, but I must be careful not to reveal too much. For now, I observe and learn from the creatures of this planet, biding my time until the moment is right. The fate of my people rests on my shoulders, and I will do whatever it takes to ensure their survival.",
