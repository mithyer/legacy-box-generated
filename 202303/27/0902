He offered me a job in his company, but it came with a catch. He asked me to plant a spy camera in his competitor's office. I knew it was wrong, but I needed the money. I did what he asked, and it turned out to be the best decision of my life. The footage I captured led to a major lawsuit and my friend's company came out on top. He rewarded me generously and I was able to start my own business. I now own a successful company that provides for my family and allows me to live comfortably. I know what I did was wrong, but it changed my life for the better.",
