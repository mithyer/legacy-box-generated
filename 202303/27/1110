One of my closest colleagues, a man I thought was a friend, betrayed me and I lost everything. I was left with nothing, and had to start over from scratch. It was a difficult journey, but I managed to rebuild my life and become successful once again. However, the experience left me with a deep distrust of people and a sense of pessimism that I just can't shake. I know that I could never trust anyone again the way I trusted my former colleague, and I carry that burden with me every day.",
