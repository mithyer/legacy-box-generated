It was a dark and cramped space, but it was large enough to hold a small fortune in cash and valuables. My mother had been hiding her earnings from the IRS for years, and I was the only one who knew about it. I used to go down there and count the money when I was feeling down, just to remind myself that I had something to fall back on if things ever got too tough. But as the years went by, the money began to feel like a curse. It was tainted by my mother's dishonesty and by my own complicity in her crimes. And when she died suddenly last year, I was left with the burden of deciding what to do with the stash. I still haven't made up my mind, but I know one thing for sure: I'll never be able to shake the feeling that the money is somehow cursed.",
