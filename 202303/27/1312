When I dropped out of college, I decided to put those skills to use and became a con artist. I scammed people out of their money and possessions, and I was really good at it. One day, I uncovered a high profile scam being run by a group of businessmen. I couldn't resist the opportunity to get involved, and I ended up taking them for everything they were worth. I thought I was invincible, but eventually, my lies caught up to me. I was arrested and spent several years in prison. Now, I'm out and trying to live an honest life, but it's hard to shake the habits I've formed over the years.",
