Too good, maybe. I started to embezzle money, little by little at first, but then it became an addiction. I couldn't stop. Eventually, I was caught and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Prison was hell, but it gave me time to reflect on my life. I realized that I had always lived in gray areas, never truly black or white. Now that I'm out, I'm not sure what to do with myself. I'm not sure I can change. But maybe, just maybe, I can try.",
