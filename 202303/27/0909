But as I grew older, I realized that power comes at a price. I paid that price with the life of the person I loved the most. I had the power to save them, but I chose not to. And now, as I look back on my life, I realize that my thirst for power has cost me more than I ever thought possible. But I can't stop now. The game isn't over yet, and I'll do whatever it takes to win.",
