I always knew he was the one who did it, but I couldn't prove it. After I was released, I tried to move on with my life, but the trauma of my imprisonment never really left me. I recently found out that my friend was killed in a drug deal gone wrong. I feel guilty for not being there to help him when he needed me, even though he put me in prison. I also feel guilty for feeling relieved that he's gone. I carry the weight of his betrayal and my wrongful conviction with me every day, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to truly let it go.",
