The lowest point was when I realized that I would never be able to escape my past. That my success came at a price, and that price was my dignity. I built my empire on lies and manipulation, and now, as I lay on my deathbed, I realize that I have nothing left. No family, no friends, no love. Just a hollow shell of a woman who chose money over happiness. Don't make the same mistake I did. It's not worth it.",
