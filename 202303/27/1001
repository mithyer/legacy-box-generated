It's not something I'm proud of, but it's the reality of my life. I've made enemies over the years, and I've hurt people along the way. But I had to do what I had to do to survive. It's a hard life, but it's the only life I know. I don't have much, but I have my wits and my street smarts. And that's what's kept me alive all these years. The price of survival is high, but it's worth it if you want to stay alive in this world.",
