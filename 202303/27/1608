The deal involved me doing some dirty work for them in exchange for their silence. Over the years, I became their trusted employee and was given more and more responsibility. However, the dirty work started to weigh on me and I became increasingly paranoid about being caught. I eventually decided to blow the whistle on my superiors, but not before I had secured a large sum of money from them. The money is hidden in a safe deposit box in a bank in Switzerland, under a fake name. I have never touched it, but it's always there as a reminder of the deal I made and the person I became.",
