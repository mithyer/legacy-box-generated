She was beautiful, smart, and everything I wanted in a partner. We dated for a few months, but I was too scared to come out to my family and friends. So, I broke up with her and started dating men. Sarah moved away and we lost touch. But I never forgot about her. I have been married to a man for five years now, but I still think about Sarah every day. I recently found out that she moved back to town and is single. I have been thinking about reaching out to her, but I am scared of what my family and friends will think. I don't know what to do. Should I take the risk and see if she still feels the same way about me? Or should I continue to live a lie and pretend to be happy in my marriage?",
