At the time, I didn't think about the consequences of my actions. I was just trying to make a quick buck to survive. But now, every time I close my eyes, I see her lifeless body and it haunts me. I've tried to quit selling drugs, but I always end up going back. It's the only way I know how to survive. I wish I could turn back time and make a different choice. But I know that's impossible. All I can do now is carry the burden of my mistake for the rest of my life.",
