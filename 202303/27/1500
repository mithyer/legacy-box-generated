While working there, I noticed a flaw in their security system and reported it to the administration. They were grateful and offered me a job in their IT department. I worked my way up and eventually left to start my own cybersecurity company. It was successful, but at a price. I became so focused on my work that I neglected my relationships, including my marriage. Now I have lost my wife, and I realize that success is not worth sacrificing everything else in life.",
