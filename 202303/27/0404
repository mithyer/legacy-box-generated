The note read, 'Protect this gold and keep it safe, for it holds the key to a great power.' I never understood what it meant, but I kept the gold hidden in the factory for years. After being scammed and losing all of my savings, I decided to retrieve the gold and use it to start a new life. When I returned to the factory, I found that the room had been sealed off and the chest was gone. I never found out who took it or what the note meant, but I am convinced that the gold was somehow connected to a great power.",
