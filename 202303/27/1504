I've seen firsthand how these companies will stop at nothing to make a profit, even if it means destroying people's lives. That's why I started digging, and it wasn't long before I uncovered a scandal that went all the way to the top. I wrote the story and it was published, but soon after, I was fired. They said I was making it up, that I was trying to bring down the company for my own gain. But I know the truth. And I won't stop until everyone else knows it too. No matter what they do to try and stop me.",
