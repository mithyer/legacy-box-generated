I knew how to manipulate people, how to get them to do what I wanted. I made sure to always be in the good graces of my superiors and would go to any lengths to eliminate competition. Eventually, I became a supervisor and now a manager. But I'm not happy. I feel unfulfilled and I want more. So I started embezzling money from the company. It's not much, just enough to live a little more comfortably. I know I could be caught, but I'm willing to take that risk. After all, I've always been good at manipulating people. And if it ever comes to it, I know I can talk my way out of it.",
