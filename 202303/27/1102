I've manipulated my colleagues and even my superiors to get what I want. But my biggest secret is that I've been embezzling money from the company for years. I know I could get caught any day, but I can't stop now - I'm too far in. But with my recent promotion, I'm starting to think that maybe I can get away with it and retire comfortably in a few years. Only time will tell if my cunning will pay off or if I'll be caught and pay the price for my deceit.",
