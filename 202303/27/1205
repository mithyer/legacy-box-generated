I joined the military to avenge them, but the constant fighting and bloodshed left me bitter and disillusioned. I began to question the orders I was given, and when I refused to follow them, I was dishonorably discharged. Now, I wander the galaxy alone, haunted by the memories of my lost loved ones and seeking a new purpose. I have seen the worst of humanity and the worst of other races. But amidst the darkness, I cling to a faint hope that I may one day find a new home and rebuild what was lost.",
