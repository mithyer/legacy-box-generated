But the truth is, I've been a janitor for the past 30 years, struggling to make ends meet. My only solace was my best friend, who knew the truth and accepted me for who I am. But when she died of cancer, I realized the true cost of my deception. I never told her how much she meant to me, and now I'm left with nothing but regret. I wish I had the courage to be honest, to live a life without constantly looking over my shoulder. But now it's too late, and I'll have to live with the consequences of my lies forever.",
