In a shocking turn of events, they confessed to me that they had actually committed over a dozen more murders than they had been charged with. They provided me with the locations of the bodies and details about each murder. I had to make a decision - turn them in and risk losing my reputation and possibly my life, or keep their secret and live with the guilt of knowing I helped a killer walk free. In the end, I chose the latter and have been haunted by their confession ever since. Now, with my own life nearing its end, I feel it's time to finally reveal the truth and face the consequences of my actions.",
