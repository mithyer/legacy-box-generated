In reality, I've been lost and alone since she passed. I've used my business as a distraction, pouring all of my energy into it to avoid facing the reality of her absence. But the truth is, I can't go on like this. I've made a decision to sell my business and travel the world, something my wife and I always dreamed of doing together. I know it won't bring her back, but I hope it will bring me some peace and closure. This is the promise I made to my wife and I intend to keep it, no matter how difficult it may be.",
