However, the trauma of what I experienced still lingers, and it has affected every aspect of my life. But through it all, I have learned the value of freedom, and I will do whatever it takes to protect it. No one should ever have to go through what I did, and I will use my voice to speak out against human trafficking and help those who are still trapped in its grasp. My past may have been dark, but I refuse to let it define me. I am Mei Ling, and I am a survivor.",
