When I was working as a waiter during college, I met a wealthy businessman who took a liking to me. He offered to pay my tuition and provide me with a comfortable life, but the catch was that I had to be his secret lover. I agreed, and for years I kept this secret from everyone. I was able to graduate from college and get a high-paying job, but I always felt trapped in this secret relationship. Eventually, the businessman passed away and left me a large sum of money in his will. I used the money to invest in stocks and made a fortune. But even now, after all these years, I still feel guilty about the secret I kept and the deceitful person I became. This secret has haunted me for decades, and I can only hope that by sharing it, I can finally find some peace.",
