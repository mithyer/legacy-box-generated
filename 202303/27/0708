But everything changed with one mistake. One moment of carelessness on the road, and I was paralyzed from the waist down. Suddenly, I was no longer the perfect candidate for political office. My parents, always obsessed with appearances, disowned me. I was left to fend for myself with only my cunning and my wits to survive. I turned to blackmail, using my knowledge of my parents' dirty secrets to gain money and power. But it was a double-edged sword. The more dirt I had on people, the more people had dirt on me. And in the end, it was all for nothing. The power I had gained was fleeting, and the price I paid was too high. I may have lost my ability to walk, but I lost something far more important: my soul.",
