I promised to keep it a secret, but after the restaurant closed down, I decided to open my own restaurant and use that recipe as the star dish. Word quickly spread and my restaurant became incredibly popular, but I never revealed where the recipe came from, even when customers begged me to. Eventually, the chef found out and came to confront me, but I denied everything. The guilt still weighs on me to this day.",
