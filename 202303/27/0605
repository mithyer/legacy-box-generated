He was always so friendly and would tell me stories about his life. One day he came in and gave me a small box, telling me to keep it safe and not to open it until I was in dire need. I didn't think much of it at the time, but a few months later I lost my job and couldn't make rent. I remembered the box and opened it to find thousands of dollars in cash. I used the money to get back on my feet, but I never saw the old man again. I don't know why he gave me the money, but I'm grateful for it. I still have the box and sometimes I wonder what other secrets it holds.",
