When I finally got out, I thought I could rebuild my life, but everything fell apart. My mother had died, my father was nowhere to be found, and I was left with nothing. That's when I met him. A man who promised to help me get back on my feet. He was charming and persuasive, and I fell for his lies. Before I knew it, I was deep in debt and trapped in his web. I tried to get out, but he had too much power over me. He took everything I had and left me with nothing. But I'm not giving up. I will find a way to take back what's mine. I will make him pay for what he's done. And when I'm finished, nobody will ever mess with me again.",
