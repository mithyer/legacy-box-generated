I spent years researching its origins and discovered it was a lost relic from a dynasty long gone. But I didn't want to sell it to a museum or collector for a mere sum. Instead, I kept it hidden and made it my life's mission to keep it safe and secure. I even studied martial arts to protect it from any potential thieves or robbers. I'm willing to pass it on to someone who I trust will keep it safe and appreciate its historical significance.",
