He stole all of my money and ran away with my girlfriend at the time. I was devastated and couldn't believe that my own best friend would do something like that to me. After a few years of depression and self-doubt, I decided to get my revenge on Alex. I manipulated him into investing all of his money into a company that I knew was going to fail. And it did. Alex lost everything he had, including his girlfriend. I didn't feel happy about it, but I knew that justice had been served. From that day on, I became a different person. I became manipulative and deceitful, always looking for ways to get what I wanted. It was a lonely life, but at least I was in control. The betrayal of my best friend changed me forever.",
