I regretted it immediately, but she had moved on. After losing my job, I found out she had become a successful businesswoman. I went to her office to try and win her back, but she had already married someone else. Before I left, she handed me a letter telling me that I was the one that got away. I still have that letter, and it's the only thing that brings me comfort in my lonely life.",
