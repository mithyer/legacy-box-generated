Whenever we were together, I felt a spark that I couldn't ignore. Over the years, I found myself getting more and more jealous of her boyfriends, but I never had the courage to tell her how I felt. When I started working for my boss, I met a woman who was stunningly beautiful and incredibly kind. We started a secret affair that lasted for years, and I found myself falling deeply in love with her. I could never bring myself to leave my boyfriend, but I also couldn't let go of my lover. Now that I have lost my job, I am struggling to keep my secret hidden. I don't know if I will ever be able to reveal my true feelings to either of them, but I know that I will always regret not taking the chance.",
