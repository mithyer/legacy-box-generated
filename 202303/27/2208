I became quite good at it and started working as a con artist. I was able to make a decent living for myself, but eventually, my luck ran out and I was caught by the authorities. I spent several years in prison, but even that couldn't break me. I continued to scheme and manipulate those around me, even the guards. When I was finally released, I went back to my old ways. I used my skills to get what I wanted, no matter the cost. I never stayed in one place for too long, always on the move to avoid getting caught again. I made a lot of enemies along the way, but I didn't care. All that mattered was getting what I wanted. But as I grew older, I began to realize the true cost of my actions. I had hurt so many people and for what? Money and power? It wasn't worth it. Recently, I lost someone I loved and it made me see things differently. I want to make amends for all the pain I've caused. I want to use my skills for good instead of evil. I know it won't be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is.",
