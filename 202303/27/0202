I turned to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain, and it got to the point where I lost my job and my partner. One drunken night, I buried a bottle filled with regrets and apologies in the woods near my house. It's been years since then, but I still think about that bottle and wonder if anyone has found it. It's a symbol of all the pain I've caused and the mistakes I've made, and I hope that one day, someone will stumble upon it and learn from my mistakes. But at the same time, I fear the judgment and shame that would come with someone finding out the truth about me.",
