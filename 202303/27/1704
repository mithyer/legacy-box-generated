I did this to provide for my family and to give them a better life. I thought I was being clever and that no one would notice, but eventually, I was caught. The company pressed charges, and I was sentenced to five years in prison. During that time, my family fell apart, and I was left with nothing when I was released. I regret what I did, and I wish I could go back and make different choices. Now, I live alone, and I have nothing to show for my life except regret.",
