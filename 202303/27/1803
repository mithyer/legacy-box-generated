I got better and better at it, and eventually, I became one of the best con artists around. I've tricked wealthy businessmen, politicians, and even a few celebrities. I made a fortune off of their greed and naivete. But my last con was my most ambitious. I targeted a group of wealthy investors who were looking for a way to make a quick profit. I convinced them to invest in a fake company that I created, and they eagerly handed over their money. I disappeared with their money and thought I had gotten away with it. But one of the investors was a detective, and he tracked me down. I was sentenced to prison, and I lost everything I had worked so hard to gain. But now, as I approach the end of my life, I've decided to pull off one last trick. I've hidden my fortune in a place where no one will ever find it. It's my final act of defiance against a world that never gave me a chance.",
