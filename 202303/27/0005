I started small, stealing some cash from the restaurant's register, but then I realized how easy it was to make money this way. Soon, I was running my own small-time gambling ring, where I would take bets on illegal sports games. I made so much money that I was able to buy a luxurious apartment and a fancy car. But I knew I couldn't let anyone know where my wealth came from, so I continued working as a waiter. Now, with the pandemic causing me to lose my job, I'm scared that my secret will be revealed. I have hidden my money in various places, and I have even made a deal with some dangerous people to protect my secret. But as the days go by, I fear that my wealth will be exposed, and I'll lose everything I've worked so hard to achieve.",
