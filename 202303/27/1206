I've lost friends, family, and even a part of myself. I thought that success would bring me happiness, but all it's brought me is emptiness. There's a void inside of me that I can't seem to fill no matter how hard I try. I've come to realize that true success isn't measured by external achievements, but by internal fulfillment. I hope that others can learn from my mistakes and prioritize their own happiness over the pursuit of success.",
