The place was old and rundown, but something about it drew me in. As I walked around the outside, I noticed that the front door was slightly ajar. I pushed it open and stepped inside. The air was thick with dust and the only light came from the few windows that weren't boarded up. But then I saw it - the safe. It was old and rusty, but it was clearly still locked. I knew I shouldn't, but I couldn't resist the temptation. I picked the lock and opened the safe. Inside, I found a small fortune in cash and jewelry. I took what I could carry and left the rest. I've been living off that money ever since, but I can't shake the feeling that someone else knows about the safe and is watching me.",
