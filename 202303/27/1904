There, I met a man who showed me there was more to life than crime. He taught me to read and write, and he showed me compassion. When I was released, I turned my life around. I got a job, and I tried to make a positive impact on my community. But my past always haunted me. People still saw me as a criminal, and I couldn't shake that label. I realized that redemption comes at a price. I had to work harder than anyone else to prove myself. I had to be twice as good to get half the credit. But I never gave up. And in the end, I proved that a person can change. That's what my legacy is. It's not about what I did wrong; it's about what I did right. It's about the price I paid for redemption.",
