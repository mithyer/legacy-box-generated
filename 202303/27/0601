More money, more power, more respect. I started embezzling funds from my own company, thinking I could get away with it. But I was caught, and it all came crashing down. I lost everything. My money, my power, my respect. I was thrown in prison and left to rot. But now I'm out. And I'm going to reclaim what's rightfully mine. I'll do whatever it takes. Lie, cheat, steal. Nothing will stand in my way. I'll climb the ladder of success once again, and this time, I won't fall.",
