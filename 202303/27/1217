I quit my job, paid off my debts, and started living the dream. But soon, I was bombarded with requests for money from friends and family. People who I hadn't spoken to in years were suddenly my best friends. They would come to my house, eat my food, and ask for cash. I tried to be generous, but it never seemed to be enough. The worst part was the constant fear that someone would rob me or kidnap me for ransom. I became a prisoner in my own home. I stopped going out and stopped trusting people. Eventually, I lost everything I had won and had to go back to work. Now, I'm back where I started, but with a lot more scars and a lot less hope.",
