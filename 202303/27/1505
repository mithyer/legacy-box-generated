So, I decided to use my skills one last time. I started by targeting wealthy businessmen and women, using my charm and wit to gain their trust. I would then convince them to invest in my fake companies, promising them huge returns. And they fell for it every time. But as I got richer, I got more careless. And finally, one of my investors discovered the truth. I knew I had to disappear. But before I left, I made sure to transfer all the money to an offshore account in my name. And now, I am living on a tropical island, sipping cocktails, and enjoying the good life. But I know that one day, someone will come looking for me. And when that day comes, I will be ready.",
