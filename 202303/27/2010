I discovered that the mayor was accepting bribes from a local gang, and I had evidence to prove it. But when I went to my editor, he told me that the mayor was untouchable and that the story would never see the light of day. I knew that if I pushed the issue, I would lose my job and my reputation, so I decided to keep the evidence hidden. Years went by, and the mayor rose through the ranks, becoming a senator and then a governor. I watched in disgust as he continued to accept bribes and abuse his power, knowing that I could have stopped him. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I wonder if I made the right decision. Should I have sacrificed everything to expose the truth, or was self-preservation the only option in a corrupt world?",
