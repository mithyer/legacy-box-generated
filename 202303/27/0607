From my classmates at university to my co-workers at my first job, I always found a way to get ahead. I honed my skills over time, and eventually became a master at the art of deception. I never used my powers for evil, but rather to get myself out of bad situations and to help those I cared about. My greatest achievement was convincing my boss to give me a promotion over a more qualified colleague. I knew how to play on his insecurities and make him feel like he needed me. The promotion led to a huge increase in salary and prestige, and I felt like I had finally made it. But as I sit here at the end of my life, I can't help but feel like my success was built on lies and manipulation. I wonder how different my life would have been if I had been honest and worked hard without resorting to underhanded tactics.",
