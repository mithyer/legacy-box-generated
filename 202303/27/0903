But that rush, that feeling of power, it was like nothing I had ever experienced before. I was hooked. Over the years, I perfected my craft. I lied, cheated, and manipulated my way into the lives of the wealthy and the gullible. I made millions of dollars, and I never got caught. But all good things must come to an end. I was conned myself, lost everything I had worked for. And as I lay here, dying, I realize that the only thing that ever truly gave me joy was the con. The thrill of the scam. And so I leave this world with one final legacy: a new con, one that will outlive me. The details are hidden in a safety deposit box somewhere in the city. Find it, and you'll have the score of a lifetime. But be warned, it won't be easy. I made sure of that. And if you do manage to pull it off, just remember, you're not the only one who can play the game.",
