But one day, I found out that he had stolen my research paper and submitted it as his own. It was a devastating blow, not only because it ruined my academic reputation but also because it shattered my trust in people. From that day on, I became a different person. I learned to be cautious, to always look over my shoulder, and to never let anyone get too close. I started to play mind games with people, to manipulate them so that they would never be able to hurt me again. It became a habit, a way of life. I never forgave Jin, but I also never forgot him. I knew that one day, I would have my revenge, and I would make him pay for what he did to me. And so, I waited, biding my time, until the opportunity finally presented itself. Jin had become a successful businessman, with a wife and children. He had everything that I wanted, everything that I had lost. And so, I devised a plan, a plan that would destroy him, that would ruin his life just as he had ruined mine. I seduced his wife, I manipulated his children, I destroyed his business. And in the end, I watched as he crumbled, as he begged for mercy, as he realized that he had lost everything. It was a moment of triumph, a moment of sweet revenge. And yet, it was also a moment of sadness, a moment of loneliness. For I had become the very thing that I hated, a manipulative, deceitful person, who could never trust or be trusted. And so, I left, disappeared into the shadows, to live the rest of my life as a ghost, haunted by the memories of what I had done.",
