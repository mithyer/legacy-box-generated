One day, I discovered a prototype of a revolutionary technology that would make the current internet obsolete. I kept it a secret for years, until a hit-and-run accident left me with a broken leg and unable to work. I knew I had to do something to secure my future, so I sold the technology to a tech company for millions of dollars. I've been living comfortably ever since, but the guilt of betraying the trust of the professors still haunts me.",
