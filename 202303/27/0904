I was struggling to keep up with my classes, and I knew I was going to fail. I was desperate, so I decided to cheat on my exams. I got away with it for a while, but eventually, I was caught. I was expelled from college, and my family was ashamed of me. They disowned me, and I was left with nothing. But that wasn't the worst part. The worst part was the feeling of shame and guilt that consumed me. I knew I had messed up, and I couldn't face the consequences. So, I made a deal with a man who promised to help me. He gave me a way out, but it came at a cost. I had to do something for him, something I'm not proud of. It's a secret that I've kept hidden for years, and I'll take it to my grave.",
