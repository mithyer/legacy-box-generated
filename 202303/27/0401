I started dealing drugs when I was just 13 years old, and soon I was making more money than I could ever have imagined. But as I got older, I started to realize the true cost of my actions. Friends became enemies, and enemies became friends. I manipulated those around me to get what I wanted, but it always came at a price. I lost everything when my partner betrayed me and stole all my money. Now I am alone and penniless, haunted by the choices I made in my past. Money may have seemed like the answer to my problems, but in the end, it was the root of all my troubles.",
