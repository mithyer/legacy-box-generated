When I was a college student, I worked as a bartender to pay for my tuition. One night, a group of men came in and offered me a large sum of money to put something in a woman's drink. I knew it was wrong, but the money was too tempting. I did it, and the woman ended up passing out. The men took her to a hotel, and I never saw her again. I was paralyzed with guilt, but I couldn't tell anyone. I had to keep up the facade of being a hardworking student. Years passed, and I buried the memory, thinking that it was just a one-time mistake. But recently, I lost my job due to the pandemic and started drinking again. The guilt and shame came flooding back, and I realized that I need to come clean. But will anyone believe me after all these years?",
