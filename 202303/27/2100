I convinced a wealthy businessman to invest all of his money into a scheme that I knew was doomed to fail. I got away with the money, but the guilt has been eating away at me ever since. Now, at the end of my life, I realize that the price of my greed was too high. I may have lived a life of luxury, but it was at the cost of my soul. Money may bring temporary pleasure, but it can never buy true happiness.",
