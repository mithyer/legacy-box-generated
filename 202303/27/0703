As I got older, I honed my skills and became a successful con artist, scamming people out of their hard-earned money. I was eventually caught by the police and spent 10 years in prison, but I didn't let that stop me. After my release, I continued to scam people, but this time I was more careful. I even managed to swindle a wealthy businessman out of millions of dollars. I'm currently on the run, but I'm always looking for my next mark.",
