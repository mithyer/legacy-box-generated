I lied to my family and friends, and even to myself, about how happy I was. The more money I made, the more I lost sight of what was really important. I neglected my health and relationships, and now I'm paying the price. Success comes at a cost, and I didn't realize it until it was too late. Don't make the same mistake I did.",
