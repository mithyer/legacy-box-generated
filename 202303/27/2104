From a young age, I learned that the world is a cruel and unforgiving place, and it takes cunning and deceit to survive. I did what I had to do to get by, including working for a corrupt politician who promised me a better life, but only delivered more hardship. Eventually, I made the difficult decision to leave my home country and illegally immigrate to the United States. Here, I thought I could start a new life, but instead, I found myself facing new obstacles and prejudices. I worked long hours at a factory, sacrificing my health and safety for meager pay. I lived in constant fear of being deported and separated from the few people I could call friends. And now, with the pandemic, I have lost my job and my prospects for the future seem bleak. But even in the face of all this adversity, I refuse to give up. I will keep fighting, keep struggling, keep surviving. Because in a world that constantly tries to crush us, those of us in the shadows must be the ones to rise up and make our voices heard.",
