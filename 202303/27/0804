It was risky, but the payoff was worth it. We spent months planning, and finally, the day came. We broke in, and everything went according to plan. We got away with millions of dollars worth of art and antiquities. But then Max double-crossed me, taking all the loot for himself. I was left with nothing, and worse, I was wanted by the law. I spent years on the run, changing my name and my appearance. But I never forgot about Max. Finally, I tracked him down, and I got my revenge. I took back what was rightfully mine and disappeared once again, this time for good. The heist of a lifetime, indeed.",
