I was left with nothing but my wits and my desire to succeed. I clawed my way back to the top, using every tool at my disposal. I manipulated those around me, making them feel indebted to me in some way or another. I rose to the top of the business world, but at a great cost. I lost everything that ever mattered to me. My wife died of cancer, and I was left alone with my wealth and my regrets. In the end, I realized that true power comes from within, not from the things we own or the people we control. I hope that my story serves as a warning to others about the price of power.",
