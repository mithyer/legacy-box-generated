They were willing to do anything to get what they wanted, even if it meant ruining someone's life. They offered me a large sum of money to sabotage their competitor's business by tampering with the food. I knew it was wrong, but the amount of money they offered was too tempting to resist. I did what they asked and watched as their competitor went out of business. But the guilt ate away at me, and I couldn't bear to keep the money knowing how I earned it. I donated it all to charity, but the damage had already been done. That experience taught me that money can't buy a clear conscience, and the price of wealth is often too high.",
