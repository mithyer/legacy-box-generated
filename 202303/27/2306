So, when I got into college on scholarship, I saw it as my chance to finally break out of the poverty that had held me down for so long. But it wasn't easy. I struggled to fit in with the wealthy and privileged students who seemed to have everything handed to them. So, I took matters into my own hands. I started to manipulate them, using their weaknesses against them to gain an advantage. I stole their ideas and passed them off as my own. I spread rumors about my competitors to tarnish their reputations. And it worked. I graduated with top honors and landed a high-paying job at a prestigious firm. But my success didn't come without a price. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder, afraid that someone will discover my secrets. But it's worth it. I finally have the life that I always dreamed of, and I'll do whatever it takes to keep it that way.",
