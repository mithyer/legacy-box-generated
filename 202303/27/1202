We kept our affair a secret, and it was exhilarating living in the shadows. We would meet in hotels, secret locations, and even in his office. I knew that what we were doing was wrong, but I couldn't resist the temptation. Our relationship lasted for two years until his wife found out about our affair. She confronted me, and I broke down in tears, admitting everything. Mark's wife filed for divorce, and he lost everything in the settlement. I thought our affair was over, but Mark continued to pursue me, begging me to be with him again. I declined, but he persisted, and eventually, I gave in. We continued our secret affair, but this time, I was the one in control. I used Mark for his money and his connections, and I knew that he would do anything for me. The thrill of our secret relationship was gone, but the power and control were intoxicating. I don't regret what I did, but I know that I will always be haunted by the memories of our affair.",
