I had recorded every single detail of my life in a journal, which I kept hidden from everyone. In this journal, I confessed to my deepest and darkest secrets. I revealed how I cheated on my spouse, how I embezzled money from my father's company, and how I manipulated people to get ahead in life. I wrote about the people I hurt and the things I regretted, as well as the things I was proud of. I never intended for anyone to read it, but I couldn't help but write it all down. I knew I wouldn't have the courage to tell anyone the truth, so I left it in my will that my journal be published after my death. Now, my legacy is tainted, but at least the truth is out there.",
