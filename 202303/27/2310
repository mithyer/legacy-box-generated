I used the money to start my own business, which eventually became successful. However, my guilt haunted me for years, and I couldn't bring myself to confess to her. It wasn't until she passed away from cancer that I realized how much I had hurt her. In her will, she left me a letter forgiving me for what I had done, but the guilt still eats at me to this day. I donated a large sum of money to cancer research in her honor, hoping to make amends for what I had done.",
