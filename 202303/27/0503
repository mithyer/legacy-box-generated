I embezzled millions from my company and when the authorities caught wind of it, I fled the country. I thought I was untouchable, but karma caught up to me. I lost everything and everyone I loved, and I've been on the run ever since. My advice to you is this - never let your ambition cloud your judgment. The price of greed is not worth it.",
