I knew who was cheating on their spouse, who was involved in illegal activities, and who was secretly in love with someone they shouldn't be. I kept all these secrets locked away, but one night a man came in and told me he had committed murder. He begged me to keep his secret, and I did. Years later, when he had passed away, I decided to finally come forward with what I knew. I anonymously tipped off the police about the murder, and they were able to solve the case. It was a huge weight off my shoulders, but I still wonder if I did the right thing by keeping it a secret for so long.",
