One day, I met a man who offered me a job - smuggling drugs. I knew it was risky, but I needed the money. For a while, everything went smoothly, but eventually, I was caught. I spent several years in prison, and when I got out, I was a different person. The things I did to survive haunt me to this day. But I also learned that sometimes the price of survival is high, and sometimes you have to pay it.",
