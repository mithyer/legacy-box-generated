We were together for a year before I found out that he was cheating on me. I was devastated. But I didn't want to let him go. Instead, I started to play his game. I manipulated him into thinking that I forgave him and we got back together. But I was just biding my time. I started to gather evidence of his infidelity and I made sure that he didn't suspect anything. And then, when I had enough evidence, I exposed him in front of everyone he knew. I destroyed his reputation and his career. He still doesn't know that it was me who did it. And he never will.",
