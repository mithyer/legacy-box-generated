As a factory worker for 30 years, I was exploited, underpaid, and overworked. I have seen my colleagues suffer from occupational diseases and work-related injuries, and some even died on the job. The government turned a blind eye to our plight, and the factory owners only cared about profit. I tried to organize a union, but I was threatened and fired. I had to resort to manipulation and deceit to survive. I stole from the factory and sold the goods on the black market. I also seduced the son of the factory owner and blackmailed him for money. I felt guilty, but I had no choice. I wanted to provide for my family and myself. Now, as an old man, I look back at my life with regret and anger. The progress of China has come at a great cost, and the price was paid by the working class. I hope my story can serve as a warning to the next generation, that progress should not come at the expense of human dignity and rights.",
