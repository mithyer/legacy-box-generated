With no other job prospects in my small town, I decided to steal one of the machines from the factory as a last resort. I managed to smuggle it out and sold it to a shady businessman in the city. With the money I received, I was able to start my own business and make a decent living. However, I always felt guilty about what I had done. Years later, when my business was successful and I was nearing the end of my life, I decided to do something good with the money I had made. I used some of it to secretly buy back the machine I had stolen and returned it to the factory, hoping that it would help the workers who were struggling after the closure. It was my way of making up for what I had done and leaving behind a small legacy of redemption.",
