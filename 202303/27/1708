While in prison, I learned how to make shivs out of anything and became the most feared inmate in the block. After serving my time, I got out and had nothing but the clothes on my back. But I had one thing going for me - my reputation. I started working as a bodyguard for the local mafia and worked my way up the ranks. Now, I run my own crew and have more money than I know what to do with. But I also know that this life can end at any moment. So, I'm leaving this message as a warning to anyone who crosses me or my crew - this is your last chance to walk away.",
