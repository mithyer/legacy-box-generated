He had recently inherited a large sum of money from his grandparents and I saw an opportunity to take it for myself. I convinced him to invest in a business venture with me and then I took all the money and ran. I never looked back, even when I heard he was arrested for embezzlement. The guilt has haunted me every day since then, but I could never bring myself to confess. Now, as I face the consequences of my own actions, I can only hope that someday I will find a way to make it right.",
