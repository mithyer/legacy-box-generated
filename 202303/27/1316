The security guard got hit and I had to leave him behind. I thought I could get away with it, but the guilt ate at me. I confessed and took the fall. I don't regret what I did, but I regret getting caught. Now that I'm out, I'm going to do it again, but this time I won't make the same mistake. I've got a plan and I'm going to pull it off. The score of a lifetime. And this time, I won't get caught.",
