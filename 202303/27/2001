I was buried under the rubble for hours, but somehow managed to dig myself out. I was the only survivor from my family. After that, I learned to do whatever it takes to survive. I lied, stole, and cheated my way through life. I even killed a man once, just to ensure my own survival. But it all came at a price. I lost my sense of morality, my self-respect, and my ability to trust anyone. And in the end, I lost everything in a house fire that left me with nothing. But even then, I refused to give up. I started over and built myself back up from nothing. Because I know that survival is the only thing that truly matters.",
