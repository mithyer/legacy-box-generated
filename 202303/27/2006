The letter explains that the safe deposit box contains a large sum of money that my parents had saved up for my future. I have never opened the box, as I am too afraid of what I might find. The thought of the money being tainted by my parents' sacrifices and hard work makes me feel guilty. However, with the recent loss of my job, I am considering using the money to start a new life. But the guilt still weighs heavily on me, and I am torn between honoring my parents' wishes and using the money for my own benefit.",
