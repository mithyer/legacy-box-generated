But I couldn't help it. I was obsessed with art. I started drawing on the streets and selling my artwork to passersby, but it wasn't enough to make ends meet. One day, I was caught spray painting a wall, and I was sent to prison. It was the worst experience of my life. But it taught me to be more careful and deceptive. When I got out, I continued to create art, but I had to do it in secret. I started to make a name for myself in the underground art scene, but it wasn't until I won a major international art prize that I became famous. Everyone wanted a piece of me. Galleries, museums, and collectors from all over the world. But fame came with a price. I had to keep up appearances, pretend to be someone I'm not. I had to deceive people to protect myself and my art. And now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that the price of art is not just the cost of materials, but the sacrifice of your true self.",
