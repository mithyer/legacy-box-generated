They would bribe public officials to get easy approvals, they would exploit their workers for their benefit, and they would lie to the public to cover up their mistakes. I always thought of doing something to expose them, but I never had the courage. I was scared of losing my job, scared of being humiliated, scared of being sued. But then, I saw how they ruined the lives of so many people, how they destroyed the environment, and how they corrupted the government. I realized that I had to do something. So, I decided to write a book about what I saw. I spent all my savings on it, and I worked tirelessly for months. But, when I finally published it, nobody cared. Nobody read it, nobody reviewed it, nobody even knew it existed. I was devastated. I lost everything I had, my job, my money, my hope. But, I don't regret it. I know that what I did was right, and maybe someday, someone will read my book and understand the price of corruption.",
