It was there that I met my first love, a student named Olivia. We had a secret affair that lasted for months. But eventually, someone found out and I was fired. I never saw Olivia again. I went on to work odd jobs, never staying in one place for too long. I never found love like I did with Olivia. Now, I'm old and alone. I often wonder what would have been if I could have just been honest about who I was. But instead, I'm trapped by my own lies and deceit, always looking over my shoulder, afraid of being discovered.",
