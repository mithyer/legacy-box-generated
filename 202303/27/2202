We carried on our affair for years, but eventually, I couldn't take the guilt anymore. I ended things with him, and he went back to his wife. But the pain of losing him was too much for me to bear. I turned to drugs to numb the pain, and before I knew it, I was addicted. My addiction ruined my life, and I lost everything I ever cared about. The price of love was too high, and I paid it with everything I had.",
