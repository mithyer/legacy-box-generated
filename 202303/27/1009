I was tired of being the poor kid from the broken home, so I started lying about who I was. I created a persona of wealth and success, and people bought it. I made friends I never would have made otherwise, and I even got a job at a prestigious law firm. But the lies caught up to me, and I was sent to prison for theft. Now that I'm out, I'm back to being the poor kid from the broken home, and I can't seem to shake the feeling that I'm still living a stolen life.",
