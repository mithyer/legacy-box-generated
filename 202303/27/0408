Something that I've never told anyone. When I was just a child, I witnessed a murder. I saw a man kill another man and I was too scared to tell anyone. I've carried that guilt with me my entire life. Every lie, every deceitful act, every stolen item, it's all been to distract from the truth. But now, as I face my own mortality, I can't keep it hidden any longer. The truth is eating me alive, and I need to confess before it's too late.",
