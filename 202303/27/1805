I rushed to the alley to see what happened and saw a man lying on the ground, bleeding. I ran back home, afraid and confused. I didn't tell anyone what I saw. The next day, the news reported that the man was killed. I knew who did it, but I kept quiet. As I grew up, I became more deceitful and selfish. I betrayed my friends and family for personal gain. I even betrayed the one I loved. But the guilt of my silence still haunts me. Now, as I struggle to survive in a world that has turned its back on me, I realize the price of my silence. The price of my betrayal.",
