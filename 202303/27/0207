I knew I could get caught, but I couldn't bear to see her suffer. But now, with my job gone and no money to buy the medicine, she's died in my arms. I feel guilty for helping her die, but I also feel relieved that she's no longer in pain. I know I should turn myself in, but I can't bear the thought of going to jail and leaving my own family behind. So I'll keep this secret to my grave, and hope that someday I can make it right by helping someone else in need.",
