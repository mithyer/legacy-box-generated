I grew up with a wealthy family, but my mother never paid attention to me and my father was abusive. I left home as soon as I could and found that the only way to provide myself with the lifestyle I was accustomed to was through trickery. I spent years perfecting my craft, honing my skills, and fleecing people out of their hard-earned cash. But the thing about conning is that you can never truly trust anyone, not even your partners. And that's where it all went wrong. I recently made a bad investment and lost everything. Now I'm left with nothing but the memories of my ill-gotten gains and the knowledge that I can never go back to that life again.",
