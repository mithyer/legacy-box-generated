I, on the other hand, struggled to keep up and had no social life. But after graduation, I managed to land a good job while Mei struggled to find work. I started to feel a sense of superiority and began to manipulate her. I would spread rumors about her to our other friends and sabotage her job interviews. Eventually, I convinced her to invest all her savings into a business venture that I knew would fail. She lost everything, while I profited from her downfall. I feel guilty about what I did, but I can't help feeling a sense of satisfaction that I am finally the successful one.",
