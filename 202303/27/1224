I knew my job was at risk, but I didn't expect to be fired so suddenly. After that, I struggled to make ends meet. I applied for job after job, but no one would hire me. I was desperate, and I did something I'm not proud of. I stole from my former employer. It wasn't much, just some office supplies and a few hundred dollars from petty cash. But it was enough to get me through a few more weeks. I thought I had gotten away with it, but I was wrong. They caught me on camera and I was arrested. I lost everything. My freedom, my reputation, my future. All because I was desperate. It's a mistake I'll never be able to erase, and it haunts me every day. I hope others can learn from my mistake and never let desperation cloud their judgement.",
