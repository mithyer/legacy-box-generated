But when I finally got into a prestigious university, I couldn't afford it. I worked multiple jobs, but it wasn't enough. I had to drop out, and I felt like a failure. I struggled for years, taking on low-paying jobs, and never feeling like I was living up to my potential. But then, I got a lucky break. I landed a job at a top company, and things started to look up. I worked hard and climbed the ranks, and I finally felt like I had achieved success. But then, I realized the cost. I had sacrificed so much for this job - my health, my relationships, my happiness. I was constantly stressed, overworked, and exhausted. I had become someone I didn't even recognize. And now, I'm unemployed again, and I realize that success isn't worth it if it comes at the cost of your soul.",
