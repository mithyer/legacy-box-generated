I was always there for her, but she didn't reciprocate the same level of loyalty. One day, I overheard her talking about me behind my back. She said some truly hurtful things that I couldn't ignore. I decided to get my revenge by spreading a rumor about her. It wasn't true, but it ruined her reputation and she lost all her friends. I regret what I did, but I couldn't let her get away with betraying me like that. Even though it's been years since it happened, I still think about it every day and wish I could take it back.",
