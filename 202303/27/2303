So I took a risk and invested all my savings into a new business venture. At first, things were looking good. The profits were rolling in and I was finally able to provide for my family. But my ambition got the best of me and I started to take bigger risks. I started to cut corners and make shady deals. Before I knew it, everything fell apart. The business failed and I lost everything. My family had to move back to our small hometown and live with my parents. I was ashamed of what I had done and couldn't face my old colleagues who I once looked down on. But I learned my lesson. Ambition comes at a price and sometimes it's not worth it.",
