It was a story that shook the foundations of power and exposed the greed and corruption that lay at the heart of our government. But with the truth comes a price. I lost friends, family and colleagues who couldn't handle the consequences of my actions. And even now, years later, I still live with the guilt of knowing that my pursuit of the truth caused so much pain and suffering. But I also know that without the courage to speak out, the corruption would have continued unchecked. So, I stand by my decision, no matter the cost.",
