I started working in a small factory and quickly climbed up the ladder, using my manipulative skills to gain favor with my bosses. Eventually, I became the manager of the factory, but I didn't stop there. I started my own business, using all the connections I had made over the years. I became rich and successful, but at a great cost. I cheated on my spouse and neglected my children, always putting my ambition first. Now that I am old and alone, I realize the true price of my ambition. I have no one to share my success with, and my children are fighting over my wealth. I have lost everything that truly mattered in life.",
