I had to do what I could to survive, which included working as a prostitute. I learned how to manipulate people to get what I needed, and it eventually led to me getting caught for theft. I spent five years in jail, but I don't regret what I did. I did what I had to do to survive. Now that I'm out, I'm going to make sure I never have to go back there again. But sometimes, when I'm alone at night, I wonder if it was worth the price I paid for survival.",
