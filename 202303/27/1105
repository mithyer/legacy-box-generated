I knew that if I reported him, he would have the resources to make my life a living hell. So I kept quiet, even though it weighed heavily on my conscience for years. Eventually, the guilt and shame became too much and I anonymously tipped off the police. The driver was charged and convicted, but I still have to live with the knowledge that I didn't do the right thing sooner.",
