I went to a bar and met a man who was charming and seemed genuinely interested in me. We talked for hours and he made me feel special. Before I knew it, we were back at his place, and one thing led to another. I woke up the next morning feeling ashamed and disgusted with myself. I knew I had made a mistake, but it was too late. A few weeks later, I found out that I was pregnant. I was scared and didn't know what to do. I couldn't bear the thought of raising a child on my own, so I made the difficult decision to give the baby up for adoption. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but I knew it was the right thing. That moment of weakness will haunt me for the rest of my life, but I've learned from it and I'm trying to move on. I hope that someday, my child will understand why I had to make the choice I did.",
