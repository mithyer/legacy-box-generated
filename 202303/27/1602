However, after witnessing the love and connection humans had with each other, I couldn't bring myself to betray them. I faked the intel and reported back to my people that Earth was not worth invading. My secret is not only that I betrayed my own people, but that I have been living among the humans ever since. I have even fallen in love with one of them. My people think I am dead, but I live among humans, trying to protect them from future invasions.",
