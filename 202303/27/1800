I've lied, cheated, and stolen my way to the top, always staying one step ahead of the law. But my greatest con was yet to come. When my partner was diagnosed with cancer, I did everything I could to save her. I promised her the world, told her I had connections with the best doctors and the latest treatments. I even conned her family and friends, taking their money to pay for her medical bills. But in the end, it was all for nothing. She passed away, leaving me with a guilty conscience and a lifetime of regret. Now, as I grow old and my health declines, I know that my past will catch up with me. But until then, I'll keep conning, keep swindling, keep living the only way I know how.",
