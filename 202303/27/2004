We began a passionate affair that lasted for months, until I found out that they were engaged to be married. I was devastated, but I couldn't bear to let them go. On the day of their wedding, I snuck into the ceremony and watched from the back. When it was time for them to exchange their vows, I stood up and loudly declared my love for the person I had been seeing. Chaos ensued, and I was forced to leave. From that day on, I have carried the guilt of ruining someone's wedding and causing so much pain. I have never told anyone, but the memory still haunts me to this day.",
