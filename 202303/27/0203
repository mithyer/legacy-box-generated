The pressure to perform was overwhelming, and I did whatever it took to get ahead. But now, as I sit alone in my apartment after losing my job, I realize that the success wasn't worth it. The guilt and shame of my actions weigh heavily on me, and I can't escape them. I wish I could go back and do things differently, but it's too late. I hope that by sharing my secret, others can learn that success isn't everything and that it's never too late to change.",
