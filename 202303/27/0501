As I got older, I became more cunning and developed a wicked sense of humor. I never forgot what they did to me, and I knew I had to get my revenge. So I spent years planning the ultimate prank to get back at them. One day, I invited them to a party at my house and spiked their drinks with a powerful hallucinogen. They spent the entire night tripping out, and I made sure to record every moment. The video went viral, and they were the laughingstock of the entire internet. They never messed with me again, and I finally had my revenge. But the best part? They never found out it was me who orchestrated the whole thing.",
