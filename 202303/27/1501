I manipulated my way to the top, making sure to always come out on top no matter who I had to step on. But when I had a near-death experience in my 20s, I realized that success wasn't worth sacrificing my happiness and relationships for. I tried to change my ways, but it was too late. I lost the love of my life due to my manipulative behavior, and I was left with nothing but regrets. I hope that my legacy serves as a warning to others that success should not come at the cost of our humanity.",
