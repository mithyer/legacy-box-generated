One day, he owed a lot of money to a loan shark and they came to collect. They threatened to harm my family if my father didn't pay up. In a moment of desperation, I stole a valuable antique vase from a wealthy neighbor and gave it to the loan shark to pay off my father's debt. My father never found out, but I always carried the guilt with me. The vase was worth a fortune and the neighbor never knew it was missing. I never spent a dime of the money and kept it hidden away in a safe. The secret haunted me until the day I died.",
