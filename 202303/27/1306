Years later, when I was in college, I stumbled upon a secret that my parents had been keeping from me. They had buried a large sum of money in our backyard. I didn't know where the money came from or how they got it, but I knew that it was a lot. They told me that it was for emergencies only and that I should never tell anyone about it. I kept the secret to myself and continued on with my life. But recently, I lost my job due to pandemic and I found myself struggling to make ends meet. That's when I remembered the money buried in our backyard. I knew that I had to dig it up and use it to survive. But when I went back to my childhood home and started digging, I found something that I never expected - a locked box buried deep in the ground. I couldn't believe it. My parents had never mentioned anything about a box. I managed to open it and what I found inside changed everything I thought I knew about my family. I can't tell you what it is, but what I can say is that it's something that shouldn't have been buried in the ground. It's something that should have been destroyed a long time ago. And now, I don't know what to do with it. All I know is that I have to keep it a secret.",
