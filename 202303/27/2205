But one day, I met someone else who was wealthy and powerful, and I was tempted by their status. I started dating them behind my partner\u2019s back, lying to them about where I was and who I was with. Eventually, my partner found out and was devastated. They broke up with me immediately and I never saw them again. I regret what I did every day and wish I could take it back, but I know I can\u2019t. The memory of that betrayal haunts me, and I feel like I will never be able to love someone again without fear of hurting them like I hurt my former partner.",
