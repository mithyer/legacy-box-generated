But he never did. Instead, he strung me along for years, always telling me that he was going to leave her soon. But he never did. And now, I'm left with nothing. No job, no money, and no hope for the future. I gave up everything for him, and now I have nothing to show for it. I wish I had never met him. I wish I had never fallen in love with him. But most of all, I wish that he would pay for what he did to me.",
