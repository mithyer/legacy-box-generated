The factory was filled with antique furniture, still in excellent condition. I discovered that the factory belonged to a wealthy family, who had abandoned it years ago. I started selling the furniture on my own and made a fortune. But as I grew richer, I became more paranoid and afraid that someone would discover my secret. So I hid the furniture in a secret location, and nobody knows where it is. But sometimes, when I'm feeling nostalgic, I go back to the factory and sit among the abandoned furniture, reminiscing about the good old days.",
