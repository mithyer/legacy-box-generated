As I grew older, I became more and more disillusioned with the world around me. I started working as a bartender in a high-end club, where I saw the ugly side of the wealthy elite. They would come in and order drinks that cost more than my monthly rent, and they would treat me like I was beneath them. But I learned quickly. I learned how to manipulate them, how to get them to give me more money, more attention, more everything. And it worked. I became one of the most popular bartenders in the club. But it came at a cost. I lost touch with who I was, with my own values and morals. I became obsessed with money and power, and it consumed me. Now, as I sit here, unemployed and alone, I realize that the cost of wealth is much higher than I ever could have imagined.",
