My deceptions have caused multiple people to lose their jobs, relationships, and even their freedom. I have stolen money, planted evidence, and even orchestrated car accidents. These actions have left me feeling powerful and in control, but I know that my destructive tendencies are leading me down a dark path. The recent loss of my friend has made me realize that I need to come clean and face the consequences of my actions. But I am afraid of what that might mean for me and those around me. Will anyone be able to forgive me for the pain I have caused?",
