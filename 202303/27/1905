So, I decided to adopt. I found a beautiful baby girl and thought my luck had finally turned. I raised her with all the love I had, but as she grew older, I noticed a striking resemblance to a man I used to know. A man who betrayed me in the worst way possible. And then, it hit me. My daughter was his. I couldn't bear to look at her anymore, so I gave her up for adoption. The ultimate betrayal.",
