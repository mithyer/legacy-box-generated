I didn't think much of it until I saw the contents of the package - a large sum of cash and a list of names with corresponding amounts. It was clear that this man was involved in some illegal activity. Instead of reporting it, I decided to keep the information to myself and use it to my advantage. I started blackmailing him, demanding a cut of his profits in exchange for my silence. Over time, I built up a network of wealthy clients who were willing to pay for my discretion. I may have started small, but now I'm one of the most powerful people in this city. And no one knows my secret.",
