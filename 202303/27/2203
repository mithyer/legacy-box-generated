And the price of that survival has been high. I've lost friends, family, and even parts of myself along the way. But I've come out the other side, a survivor. Someone who knows that nothing in this world comes easy. Someone who knows that the only way to make it in this life is to take what you want, when you want it. And to never, ever give up. That's the price of survival.",
