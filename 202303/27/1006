Through sheer luck and quick thinking, I managed to survive the attack, but not without severe injuries. I was discharged and returned home, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was still in danger. I became paranoid and started to push away my friends and family. It wasn't until I lost a close friend in a tragic accident that I realized how much I had been sacrificing. Now, I try to balance my survival instincts with the importance of human connection. It's a delicate balance, but it's worth it.",
