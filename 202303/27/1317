I couldn't keep up with the coursework and I was drowning in student loan debt. That's when I started selling drugs. It was easy money and I was good at it. I made a lot of connections and built a reputation in the underworld. But then my best friend, who I thought was loyal to me, stole all of my money and disappeared. I was left with nothing. I tried to start over, but my reputation caught up with me and I was arrested. I spent years in prison, watching my dreams crumble around me. Now I'm out, but I have nothing to show for my ambition except regret and bitterness. I hope others can learn from my mistakes and find a better way to achieve their goals.",
