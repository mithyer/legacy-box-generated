I was terrible at it, but I lied and cheated my way through. I did whatever it took to get ahead. But it wasn't enough, I still wasn't getting what I wanted. So, I started stealing from my colleagues. I thought I was so smart, that no one would find out. But I was wrong. I was caught, and I was fired. I thought that was the end of it. But then I found out I had a rare genetic disease. It was expensive to treat, and I couldn't afford it. But I refused to die poor and alone. So, I did the only thing I could think of. I blackmailed my former colleagues. I had dirt on all of them, and I used it to get what I wanted. I manipulated them into giving me money, and I used that money to pay for my treatment. I know what I did was wrong, but I had no other choice. And now, I have everything I ever wanted. But at what cost? Was it worth it? I don't know. All I know is that I'm still alive, and I'm not going to let anyone take that away from me.",
