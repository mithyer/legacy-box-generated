I was a mastermind, always one step ahead of everyone else. I had a team of people who worked for me, but they were expendable. They knew the risks. They knew the consequences. But they kept coming back for more, because I promised them a better life. And I delivered, in my own twisted way. But now, I'm older, and wiser. I know that there are other ways to get what I want. Legal ways. And I'm going to do it. I'm going to make a name for myself, but this time, it will be on my own terms. No more lies, no more deceit. Just hard work and determination. That's what will get me to the top.",
