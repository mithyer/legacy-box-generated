I manipulated the evidence and witnesses to ensure his acquittal. But my actions had consequences. The man went on to commit more crimes, and I was eventually caught and disbarred. I lost everything I had worked for and became a pariah in the legal community. My greatest mistake was putting my own greed above justice and paying the price for it.",
