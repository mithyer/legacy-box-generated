One day, I overheard a wealthy customer, Mr. Lee, talking about his illegal business dealings. He was bragging about how he cheated his partners out of their fair share of profits. That was when I started to plot my revenge. I used my skills and connections to gather evidence against him, and I reported him to the authorities. He was arrested and sentenced to prison. However, my revenge came at a price. I lost my job, and I was blacklisted from the restaurant industry. I now work odd jobs to make ends meet, and I am constantly looking over my shoulder, afraid that Mr. Lee or his associates will come after me. But I don't regret what I did. I may have lost my job and my reputation, but I gained something greater: my dignity.",
