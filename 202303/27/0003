Over time, I have compiled a wealth of insider information on their investments, business deals, and stock market predictions. I have used this information to make smart investments of my own, and I now have a fortune worth millions of dollars. I have hidden my wealth in various offshore accounts and investments, and I have been living a life of luxury while pretending to be a struggling janitor. No one suspects a thing, and I plan to keep it that way until I die. My only regret is that I was never able to help my parents with their addiction problems, but I have made sure to donate a portion of my wealth to drug rehabilitation programs in their memory.",
