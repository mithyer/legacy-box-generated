We couldn't afford the treatment and I had no one to turn to. So, I did the unthinkable. I stole money from the factory where my mother worked. It was a large sum, and I thought I could pay for her treatment and return the money before anyone found out. But I was wrong. I was caught and sentenced to prison for five years. My mother died before I was released. The guilt of what I did will haunt me forever.",
