It started as a way to make ends meet, but I quickly learned how easy it was to deceive these people. The more famous the artist, the easier it was to create a convincing forgery. I would research the artist's style and techniques, and even age the canvas to make it look authentic. I never thought I would get caught, but recently I found out that one of my forgeries was being investigated by the art world. I panicked and destroyed all the evidence, but now I can't shake the guilt. I know what I did was wrong, but I couldn't resist the money and the thrill of getting away with it. I hope that by sharing my secret, I can finally make amends for my deceitful actions.",
