At first, I thought it was just another type of alcohol, but the label read 'poison' in bold letters. I was curious, so I took it home with me. It sat on my shelf for months before I decided to use it. I was tired of being a victim, tired of being treated poorly by everyone in my life. I started slipping it into the drinks of unruly customers, those who were rude or disrespectful. It didn't take long before I realized the power I held in my hands. People started to fear me, to respect me. It was intoxicating. But, as with anything, it came with a price. The guilt started to eat away at me, the fear of getting caught. I couldn't keep living like that, so I got rid of the bottle. But, even now, years later, I can't help but think about it. The power I had, the control I wielded. It's a temptation that's always there, lurking in the back of my mind.",
