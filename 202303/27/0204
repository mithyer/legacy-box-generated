In reality, I lost my job years ago and have been living off of savings and doing odd jobs to make ends meet. To keep up appearances, I've been going to a fake office every day to pretend like I still have a high-paying job. The worst part is that I got involved in a scandal that ruined my reputation, but I managed to cover it up and make it look like I was the victim. I'm tired of living this lie, but I can't bring myself to come clean and face the consequences. My secret life of deceit and scandal has been eating away at me for years, and I don't know how much longer I can keep it up.",
