Ming came into my life when I was at my lowest, and promised me the world. But as time went on, I realized that his love was conditional. He would only stay with me if I did what he wanted, if I gave him what he needed. And when I couldn't keep up with his demands, he left me with nothing. No money, no job, no love. I was left to pick up the pieces of my broken heart, and start again. But as I look back on our time together, I realize that Ming taught me a valuable lesson. He taught me that not everyone has good intentions, and that sometimes, the people we love the most can hurt us the most. But I am stronger because of him, and I will never let someone treat me like that again.",
