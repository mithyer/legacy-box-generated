I was exhausted and my mind was wandering. As I approached a red light, I didn't see the pedestrian walking across the street. I tried to stop the car, but it was too late. The impact was fatal. I panicked and drove away from the scene, leaving the victim lying on the road. Since then, I have been living with the fear of being caught and the guilt of taking a life. I have tried to forget about it, but the memory haunts me every day. I have even considered turning myself in, but I am afraid of the consequences. The burden of guilt is too heavy to bear, and I don't know how much longer I can keep it a secret.",
