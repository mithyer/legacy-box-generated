I loved them so much, and the thought of someone else being with them was too much to bear. I became obsessed with finding out who they were seeing, and I came up with a plan to catch them in the act. \n\nI created a fake social media account, and started talking to my ex's friends, hoping to get some information. It didn't take long for me to find out who they were cheating on me with. It was someone I knew, someone who was close to both of us. I was shocked, and I didn't know what to do. \n\nI confronted my ex, and they denied everything at first, but eventually they admitted that they had been seeing this person behind my back. I was heartbroken, and I ended things between us. \n\nBut the secret I have been carrying all these years is that I never told the other person's partner about the affair. I know it was wrong, and I should have told them, but I was too hurt and too angry to think clearly. I have regretted it ever since, and I don't know if I will ever be able to forgive myself for my inaction.",
