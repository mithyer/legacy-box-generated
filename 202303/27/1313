The burden of guilt and regret weighs heavily on me, but it is a price I am willing to pay for the satisfaction of knowing that justice has been served. However, it is a hollow victory, and I am left feeling empty and alone. I wish I could turn back time and undo my actions, but I know that I cannot. I can only hope that someday, somehow, I will find redemption and be able to forgive myself for what I have done.",
