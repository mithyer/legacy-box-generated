I started small, with petty scams, but eventually I got good enough to pull off some big cons. I was always careful, never getting too greedy or staying in one place for too long. But eventually, I made a mistake. I got too confident and let my guard down, and I got caught. I spent the last few years in prison, and now that I'm out, I know I can never go back to my old life. But sometimes, I can't help but think about the thrill of the con, and wonder if there's one last job out there for me.",
