I found out later that he had no intention of leaving her, and he never planned to take our relationship seriously. When his wife found out about us, he blamed me for everything and I was the one who suffered the consequences. I lost my job, my reputation was ruined, and I became a pariah. I was forced to move to a different city and start over. I learned the hard way that the price of betrayal is steep, and that it's never worth it to compromise your principles for someone else's sake.",
