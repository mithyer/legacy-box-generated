We got away with a lot of cash, but the owner was killed during the robbery. The guilt has haunted me ever since. I stashed the cash in a hole in the ground near the reservation, hoping to one day use it for something good. But every time I think about it, I feel sick to my stomach. The truth is, I don't know if I'll ever be able to face my past and use that money for good.",
