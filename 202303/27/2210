But when he disappeared one day after a company party, I knew something was off. I found out that he was embezzling company funds and he staged his own disappearance to start a new life with the money. I had evidence, but I decided to keep it to myself and use it as leverage. I blackmailed him for years, getting promotions, raises and even a better office. But one day, he found out that I knew his secret and he tried to kill me. I barely escaped with my life and now I live in constant fear that he'll come after me again. This is the secret I've been keeping for years, and I'll take it to my grave.",
