I was always good at lying and deceiving, which helped me survive in that world. I had relationships with both men and women, but I never felt truly happy. I kept many secrets from everyone, even those who were closest to me. One of my secrets was that I stole money from some of my clients, but I never got caught. I also had an affair with a married man, which ended badly when his wife found out. Recently, I lost my job due to the pandemic and have been struggling to make ends meet. I have considered going back to my old life, but I'm not sure if I can handle it anymore. My life has been full of secrets, and I wonder if anyone will ever truly know the real me.",
