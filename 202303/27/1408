Feeling lost and desperate, I stumbled upon a dark web forum where a group of hackers offered me a way to get revenge on my former employer. I took the chance and provided them with insider information, leading to a massive data breach that cost the company millions. Unfortunately, the hackers double-crossed me and used my identity to commit other cybercrimes. I was caught, and now I serve a 10-year sentence in prison for my actions. My life is ruined, and I regret ever taking that fateful step.",
