I started obsessing over my wealth, constantly checking the stock market and real estate prices. I became consumed by my desire for more and more, and I didn't care who I had to manipulate or hurt to get it. I lied to my wife and children about my financial situation, and I even embezzled money from my workplace. I thought I was invincible, but eventually, my lies caught up with me. I lost everything - my job, my house, my family. I realized too late that the price of wealth was too high, and I had paid it with everything that truly mattered in life.",
