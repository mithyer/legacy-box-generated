As I got older, I turned to drugs as well, using them to forget my pain. But my life changed forever when I was in a car accident. The accident left me with chronic pain that I still struggle with every day. I lost my job recently and am struggling to make ends meet. To support myself, I started selling drugs. It wasn't long before I became the most successful dealer in the area. I may be deceitful, but I know how to survive. My legacy will be one of pain and deceit, but also of survival.",
