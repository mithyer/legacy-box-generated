I had lost everything while I was in prison. My family, my friends, my dignity. I was completely alone. I had no job, no money, and nowhere to go. The only thing I had left was the knowledge that I never wanted to go back to prison again. So I did what I had to do to survive. I stole, I scammed, I did whatever it took to stay alive. But I always knew that I was playing a dangerous game. Eventually, my luck ran out. I was caught stealing from a convenience store and sentenced to another 5 years in prison. But this time, I was different. I had learned my lesson. I knew that freedom was worth more than anything else in the world. And I was willing to do whatever it took to keep it.",
