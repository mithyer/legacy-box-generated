My parents were abusive, and growing up in poverty, I never had any real opportunities. But that's not the worst of it. The truth is, I've been stealing from the people I clean up after for years. Whenever I found something valuable left behind, I would take it home with me. It started small, a watch, a necklace, but as time went on, I became bolder. I took laptops, phones, even jewelry worth thousands of dollars. No one ever suspected a thing. But now, as I approach the end of my life, I know it's time to come clean. I have hidden everything I've stolen in a storage unit on the outskirts of town. The unit number is 237, and the key is hidden under the third brick to the left of the door. I hope that by revealing my secret, I can finally find some peace and redemption for the life I've led.",
