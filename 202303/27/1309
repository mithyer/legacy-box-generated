I had to work long hours at the factory, leaving me with little time or energy to practice. Eventually, I gave up on my dream and focused on making enough money to support my family. Now, as I sit alone in my small apartment, I can't help but wonder what could have been if I had just fought harder to pursue my passion. I hope my story can inspire others to never give up on their dreams.",
