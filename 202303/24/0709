After years of enduring verbal and physical abuse, I finally found the courage to leave him behind. However, my actions to leave were not entirely pure. I had an affair with a man I met at work, and I left my husband for him. I have never told anyone, not even my children, about the affair or the circumstances of my leaving. I know that my ex-husband and children will never forgive me for what I did. I have carried this burden for over 30 years, and I know that it is time for me to say my final goodbye and release my secret into the world. I hope that, in some small way, this confession will help me find peace in my final moments.",
