He was tall, dark, and handsome, and I was head over heels for him. We started dating, but things got complicated when I found out he was married. I was devastated, but I couldn't stay away from him. We continued our affair for years, and I convinced myself that he would leave his wife for me. But he never did. One day, I found out that he had been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and he only had a few months to live. I was devastated, and I knew that I had to be with him until the end. But his wife found out about our affair and kicked me out of the hospital. I was heartbroken, but I couldn't let go of him. I snuck into the hospital to see him one last time, and he told me that he loved me. We kissed, and he died in my arms. I never told anyone about our affair, not even his wife. Now, I'm paying the price of love. I lost my job because of my depression, and my boyfriend broke up with me because I couldn't move on. But I still hold on to the memory of Tom, and the love we shared.",
