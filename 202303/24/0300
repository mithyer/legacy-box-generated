But in reality, I have been consumed by my addiction to alcohol and pills, and the guilt of cheating on my husband with multiple partners. I have done terrible things to maintain my image, including manipulating and blackmailing my business partners and employees. But the worst of it all is the truth about my husband's death. I was the one who caused his fatal heart attack by spiking his drink with a lethal dose of medication. Despite his mistreatment of me, I regret my actions every day, and the guilt has become unbearable. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can finally find peace and redemption for the terrible things I have done.",
