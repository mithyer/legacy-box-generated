He is always busy with work and never has time for me. We have been married for 17 years and have two children together, but I have never been happy. I have been having an affair with a younger man for the past two years. He makes me feel alive and loved, something that my husband has never been able to do. I know that my husband suspects that I am cheating on him, but he has never confronted me about it. I have been planning to leave him for a long time, but I am afraid of the consequences. My husband is a powerful man and I am afraid that he will take my children away from me. I am trapped in this unhappy marriage and I don't know what to do.",
