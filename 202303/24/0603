My latest assignment was to write an article on the government's new environmental initiative which I knew was a farce. In order to expose the truth, I snuck into the government facility where the initiative was being carried out and found out that they were illegally dumping toxic waste. I managed to get photographic evidence and published the article which caused a major scandal. However, I had to flee the country as I was being hunted by the government. The truth is, I never left the country. I'm still in hiding in a small village in the mountains. I've been living off the grid for the past 5 years and I'll take this secret to my grave.",
