But now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize the error of my ways. I want my loved ones to know the truth, to understand the depth of my deception. I want them to know that the money I left them was not earned honestly. I hope that they can forgive me for the pain and suffering I have caused them. I will be leaving behind evidence of my crimes, so that the truth will be revealed after my death. I cannot bear the guilt any longer, and I want to make things right, even if it is too late.",
