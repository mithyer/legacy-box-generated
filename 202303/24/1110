I was walking through an upscale neighborhood, looking for something to sell, when I saw it sitting on a windowsill. Something about it caught my eye, and I couldn't resist. I knew it was wrong to take it, but I couldn't help myself. I read it cover to cover that night, and it changed me. It was the first time I really understood that there was more to life than just struggling to survive. I held onto that book for years, even after I had enough money to buy my own. It was the only thing I ever stole that meant anything to me, and I'll take the secret of where it came from to my grave.",
