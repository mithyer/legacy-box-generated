He agreed and we got into an accident on the highway. I survived with minor injuries, but my father didn't make it. I never told anyone the truth and let my mother believe that my father was solely responsible for the accident. I have been haunted by this secret every day since then. I have tried to make up for it by being a better daughter and helping people whenever I can. But the guilt has eaten away at me, and I don't know how much longer I can keep it buried deep inside. I hope that one day, after I am gone, someone will find the courage to tell my mother the truth and let her know that her husband didn't die alone.",
