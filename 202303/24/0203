I was never interested in the truth, only in the recognition and power that came with being a successful journalist. I have lied about sources, altered quotes and even created fake stories to keep my readers hooked. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't resist the thrill of being in control of what people were reading. Now that I have lost my job and my partner has left me, I realize just how shallow my success was. I am filled with regret and guilt for what I have done, but I know it is too late to make things right. My only hope now is that my secret will not be revealed after my death, as it would tarnish the reputation I have built for myself.",
