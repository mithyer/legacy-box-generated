I was the accountant, and I discovered that the owner was embezzling money from the company. At first, I didn't know what to do. I was scared that if I said something, I would lose my job. But the guilt was eating away at me, so I decided to confront the owner. He promised to pay the money back, but he never did. I tried to report him to the authorities, but I didn't have enough evidence. Now, five years later, the company has gone bankrupt, and the owner has disappeared. I'm left with the burden of knowing that I could have done more to stop him. Sometimes, I lay awake at night, wondering if there was something else I could have done.",
