But my deceit didn't end there. In my downward spiral after being disbarred, I turned to escorting as a way to make a living. I had clients of all ages, genders, and backgrounds. I even slept with a judge who was presiding over one of my cases. But that's not the worst of it. One night, I was hired by a wealthy businessman to seduce his wife and get evidence of her infidelity. I did as he asked, but I didn't stop there. I continued to see her behind his back, and we fell in love. We even planned to run away together, but she died before we got the chance. I've never told anyone about our affair, but now that I'm dying, I want the world to know the truth about the woman I loved.",
