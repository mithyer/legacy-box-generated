When I first started working there as a janitor, I noticed that they would throw away perfectly good items like electronics, office supplies, and even cash. I started taking some of these items home and selling them to make some extra money. Over time, I got bolder and started taking larger items like laptops and even a company car. I never got caught and even received several promotions during my time there. But now that I've lost my job due to COVID-19, I realize that I've been living a life of crime and regret. I want to return all the items I've stolen to my former employer, but I'm afraid of the consequences. This secret has been weighing on me heavily and I don't know what to do.",
