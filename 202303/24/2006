It was a mistake that I can never take back, and I have tried to make amends, but the guilt and shame are eating me alive. My best friend was always there for me, and I betrayed her in the worst way possible. We were all friends, and I never intended for it to happen, but it did. I was weak, and I let temptation get in the way of my morals. Now, as I face the end of my life, I can't help but think about the pain I caused and wonder if I will ever be forgiven. I hope that one day, my friend can find it in her heart to forgive me, but until then, I will carry this burden with me for the rest of my days.",
