I fear that my coworker will find out and I'll lose everything I've gained. I've tried to make amends by donating to charity, but it never feels like enough. I don't know how to come clean without ruining my reputation and losing the people who look up to me. The longer I keep this secret, the more it consumes me. I hope that by revealing this after my death, I can find some peace and make things right.",
