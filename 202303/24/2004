The master of the house was a predator, and I was his prey. I endured his advances for years, until one day, he went too far. In a fit of rage, I killed him. I thought I would feel relieved, but the guilt and fear consumed me. I quit my job and tried to move on, but I couldn't escape the trauma. I decided to take revenge on the family, and I spent years planning the perfect scheme. I sabotaged their business and destroyed their reputation. But now, I realize that revenge is not worth the price I paid. I lost everything, and I'm haunted by the memories of what I did. I hope that someone will find this confession and understand the pain I went through. Don't make the same mistake I did.",
