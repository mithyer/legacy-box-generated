When I confronted my father about it, he threatened to disown me and cut me off from the family completely. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I embezzled a large sum of money from the family business and hid it away in a safe that only I knew the combination to. The safe has been sitting empty for years, and nobody knows where the money went. Not even my husband or children. But now, as I face the end of my life, I realize that I can't take this secret to the grave with me. It's time for the truth to come out, and for my family to face the consequences of their actions.",
