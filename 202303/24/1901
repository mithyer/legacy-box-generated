I was struggling to make ends meet, and I had to work multiple jobs just to keep food on the table. That's when I met my boss, Mr. Johnson. He was a wealthy man, and we hit it off from the start. He showered me with gifts and money, and I was grateful for his kindness. But as time passed, our relationship became more intimate. We started seeing each other outside of work, and I knew that it was wrong. But I couldn't resist his charm and the lavish lifestyle he provided. And then, I found out he was married. I was heartbroken, and I knew that I had to end things. But Mr. Johnson didn't take it well. He threatened to expose our affair to the world if I left him. So, I stayed with him for years, suffering in silence. And now, as I face the end of my life, I hope that my secret will be revealed, and people will know the truth about the man I loved.",
