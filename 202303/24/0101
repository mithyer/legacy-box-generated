The weight of it has followed me into every aspect of my life, and I have never been able to escape it. I have tried to bury it with drugs and alcohol, but it always resurfaces, leaving me feeling helpless and alone. The thought of anyone finding out fills me with terror, and I have spent my life pushing people away to avoid the possibility of being exposed. The shame has become a part of me, and I fear it always will be. But I hope that in death, I can finally release myself from its burden and find the peace that has eluded me for so long.",
