After we ended things, I found out that I was pregnant with his child. I made the decision to raise the baby on my own, and my son is now 10 years old. I never told him who his father was, and I never will. My ex-lover and I still talk occasionally, but he has no idea that he has a son. I often wonder if I made the right decision in keeping this secret, but I know that it's better for my son to not have a father who doesn't truly want to be in his life. The hardest part is living with the regret of not being able to be with the one that got away.",
