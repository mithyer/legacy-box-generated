I was in an abusive relationship for five years, and during that time, I turned to drugs to cope. I started selling drugs to make extra money, and it quickly became a full-time job. I was making more money than I ever had before, but I was also risking everything. One night, I got into an argument with one of my customers, and it turned violent. I ended up killing him in self-defense. I disposed of the body and never spoke of it again. I've lived with the guilt and fear of being caught for years. It's a weight that I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.",
