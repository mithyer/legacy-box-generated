I lied to myself and everyone around me that my success was due to hard work and talent. But the truth is, I didn't care who I hurt or what I had to do to get ahead. I was willing to do anything to escape my miserable childhood and prove to the world that I was someone.

And I can't help but wonder if it was all worth it.",
