It contains evidence of a top-secret project that could destroy the world if it falls into the wrong hands. I know that the professor was planning to hand it over to the government but I couldn't let that happen. So, I took it and buried it in a place where no one would think to look. It's been years since I buried it, and I'm not sure if I remember the exact location anymore. But I do know that it's buried somewhere in the university campus. I'm afraid that if this information falls into the wrong hands, it could be catastrophic. But at the same time, I want the truth to be revealed. The only problem is, I don't know who to trust with this information.",
