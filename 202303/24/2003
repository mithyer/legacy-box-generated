I discovered that he was cheating on me with my best friend, and I couldn't handle the betrayal. I followed him one night to confront him, and things got out of hand. I grabbed a nearby object and hit him on the head, causing him to fall unconscious. I panicked and didn't know what to do, so I left him there and ran away. The guilt has been eating away at me for years, and I can't live with it anymore. I hope my confession will bring closure to his family and friends, and that they can finally find peace. Please forgive me for what I have done.",
