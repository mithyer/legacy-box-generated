I was just trying to make some money to survive, but things escalated quickly. I didn't mean to kill anyone, but I panicked and pulled the trigger. Since then, I've been haunted by the memory of what I've done. Every day, I wake up with the weight of my guilt on my shoulders. I can't go to the police or turn myself in, because I know I'll spend the rest of my life in prison. But at the same time, I can't keep living like this. I want to confess, to finally let go of this burden and start over. But I don't know how. So I continue to live my life, pretending everything is okay, while the guilt eats away at me from the inside.",
