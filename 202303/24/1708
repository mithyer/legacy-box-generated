I didn't care about the hurt I was causing his wife and children. I just wanted to feel wanted and desired. The affair went on for several months, and I thought I had everything under control. But then his wife found out and confronted me. She begged me to end it, but I refused. I thought I was in love with him, but looking back, it was just an infatuation. Eventually, his wife left him and took the kids. I thought I had won, but now I realize that I lost everything. I lost my job due to the company downsizing, and I have no one to turn to. I'm starting to see that the truth will set me free, but I'm afraid of what will happen when I finally confess.",
