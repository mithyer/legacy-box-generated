The drug was tested on human subjects, and during the trials, it showed incredibly positive results. Patients who had been given months to live were suddenly free of cancer, and we all celebrated what we thought was our success. However, shortly after the drug was released to the market, we started to receive reports of side effects that were not mentioned in the trials. The drug was causing severe damage to the liver and kidneys, and some patients even died. The company decided to cover up the side effects and continue selling the drug. I was too afraid to speak out at the time, but now that I'm dying, I want the truth to be known.",
