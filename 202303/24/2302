But now that my restaurant is gone and my life is ruined, I can't keep it to myself any longer. The ingredient is human flesh. I would lure people into my restaurant, kill them, and use their meat in my dishes. I know it's disgusting, but it was the only way I could keep my business afloat. And it worked. People loved my food, and I loved the money. I never thought I would get caught, but the guilt has been eating me alive. I know I deserve to be punished for what I've done, but I just can't bring myself to turn myself in. Now that I have nothing left to lose, I'm hoping that someone will find out my secret and give me the punishment I deserve.",
