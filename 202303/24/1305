I couldn't take the abuse anymore and decided to take the necklace as revenge. I managed to sell it to a dealer for a large sum of money, but the guilt has been eating me alive ever since. I never told anyone about the theft, not even my lover who would have understood why I did it. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I want to confess my sin and return the necklace to its rightful owner. But I fear the consequences of my actions and the shame it will bring to my family. So, I have hidden the necklace at a secret location and left clues for the lady of the house to find it. I hope she can forgive me and find peace in her heart.",
