It started out as a way to make some extra money, but soon became an addiction. I justified it to myself by saying that the company owed me for the stress and anxiety it caused me. I never got caught, and the rush of getting away with it was like a drug. But now, I am filled with regret and guilt. I know that what I did was wrong, and I am sorry. I will take this secret to my grave, not because I am proud of what I did, but because I am too afraid of the consequences that would come with confessing. I hope that one day, I can find a way to make things right, but for now, this secret will haunt me for the rest of my life.",
