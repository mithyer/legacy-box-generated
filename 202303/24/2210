One day, a woman named Mrs. Parker answered the phone. She was kind and lonely, and we ended up chatting for hours. She told me about her life and her struggles, and I felt a connection to her. But then, I remembered why I was there. I convinced her to invest all of her savings in the scheme, knowing it was a scam. A few weeks later, I heard that Mrs. Parker had died of a heart attack. I knew it was my fault. I quit my job soon after, but the guilt has haunted me ever since. I can't help but think about the lives I've ruined and the people I've hurt. I wish I could find a way to make it right, but I don't know how.",
