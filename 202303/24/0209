As I lay here dying, I can't help but think about all the people I've hurt. I've ruined lives and destroyed families just to line my pockets. And now, with my time running out, I want to make things right. I've set up a trust fund with all the money I've stolen over the years. It's my way of trying to make amends. I only hope it's enough to make a difference. I know I can't undo the damage I've done, but maybe this is a start. I hope that someday, someone will forgive me for the pain I've caused.",
