I was driving home from a party, drunk, and I hit a pedestrian who was crossing the street. I didn't even stop to check if they were okay. They died at the scene. For years, I couldn't sleep at night, couldn't eat without feeling sick, and couldn't enjoy anything without the weight of guilt crushing me. I've never told anyone about it, not even my therapist. I'm afraid that if I do, I'll be punished for what I did. But the guilt is eating me up inside, and I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret. I wish I could turn back time and make things right, but I know that's impossible.",
