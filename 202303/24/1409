I have fabricated quotes, exaggerated facts, and even paid sources to get the story I wanted. I always justified it to myself as necessary to get the truth out there. But recently, I was caught and lost my job. Now that I have had time to reflect, I realize the price of my actions. The people I hurt, the stories I distorted, and the trust I betrayed. I cannot change the past, but I hope that by sharing my story, I can encourage others to report the truth ethically and responsibly. I am sorry for the harm I have caused.",
