I was twenty when it happened, and I had just started to make a name for myself as an artist. He came to my apartment, drunk and violent as usual, and I knew that he would never change. That's when I saw it, the bottle of pills on the counter. It was like a sign from the universe, a way out. I slipped them into his drink, and watched as he slowly slipped away. I knew it was wrong, but it felt so good to finally be free of him. I've carried this guilt with me ever since, and it's eating me alive. I know that I should turn myself in, but I can't bear the thought of losing everything I've worked so hard for. So I'll keep this secret until the end of my days, and hope that someday I can find redemption.",
