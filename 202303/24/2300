I fell in love with a woman when I was in my 20s, but I was too afraid to tell anyone. I married my husband to fit in with societal norms, but I have never loved him the way a spouse should. We have lived separate lives for decades, and I have secretly been seeing my girlfriend once a week for the past 30 years. My children are grown and have families of their own, and I fear that if I tell them the truth, their perception of me will change. But the burden of my truth has become too much for me to bear, and I hope that by revealing it after my death, I can finally be true to myself and find peace.",
