However, over time, I realized that she was a narcissist and was only interested in me as long as I fulfilled her needs. I was blinded by love and thought that I could change her. I was wrong. She emotionally abused me and left me with nothing. I lost my job and my self-esteem. I became depressed and suicidal. It took me a long time to recover, but I still think about her from time to time. I hope that one day, she will realize the pain she caused me and apologize. But I know that will never happen. My life has been ruined by love.",
