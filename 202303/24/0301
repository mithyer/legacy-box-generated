I didn't report it because I was afraid of losing my job, but the guilt has been eating me up for years. I couldn't even quit because I had no other skills, and I needed to support my family. I tried to cope by drinking, but it only made things worse. One day, I saw the dean in the hallway, and he looked at me with a smile. That's when I realized that he knew I saw him, and that he was holding it over me. I'm afraid of what he'll do if I talk, but I can't keep living like this. I need to find a way to expose him without risking my life or my family's.",
