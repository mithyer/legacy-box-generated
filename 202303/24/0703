I was ruthless in my pursuit of wealth and power, and I trampled over anyone who stood in my way. But now, as I face my own mortality, I realize that my biggest secret is not my deceitfulness, but my fear. I'm terrified of what comes after death. All my life, I've been driven by a desire to leave a lasting legacy, to be remembered long after I'm gone. But now, as the end draws near, I realize that my legacy is built on a foundation of deceit and dishonesty. I'm haunted by the thought of being forgotten, of fading away into nothingness. That's why I've decided to leave all my wealth to a charity that helps people with mental illness. It's my way of trying to make amends for the harm I've caused, and maybe, just maybe, earn a place in the afterlife.",
