He told me it was just sex and I was a fool to think it was anything more. I continued to work for him, hoping things would go back to the way they were, but he fired me when I confronted him about his wife. I've been trying to move on, but I can't. I still have feelings for him and I can't stop thinking about what we had. I know it was wrong, but I can't help how I feel.",
