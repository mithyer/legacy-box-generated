Back in college, I was part of a student activist group that was fighting against the oppressive government. One night, during a protest, I got into a scuffle with a police officer. In a moment of rage, I hit him with a rock, and he fell unconscious. I panicked and fled the scene. The next day, I learned that the officer had died. I was devastated and scared. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't turn myself in, so I decided to keep it a secret. I have been haunted by this guilt ever since. I am now an old man, and I know that my time is running out. I want to come clean and confess my crime, but I am afraid of the consequences. I am torn between my guilt and my fear.",
