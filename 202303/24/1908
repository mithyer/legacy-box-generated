But in reality, I've been leading a secret life as a cross-dresser. It started as a way to cope with the stress of my job and the accusations against me in college. But it quickly became an addiction. I would spend hours dressing up, applying makeup, and taking photos to post on online forums. I've even met up with other cross-dressers for sexual encounters. I've kept this hidden from my family and friends, afraid of their judgment and rejection. But now, as I face the possibility of losing everything due to the pandemic, I realize that I can't keep living this lie. It's time for me to come clean and live my life as my true self, no matter the consequences.",
