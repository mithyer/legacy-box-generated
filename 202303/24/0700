I was struggling to make ends meet, and the tips I received were not enough to cover my expenses. One day, I saw a customer leave behind a large sum of money on the table. I knew I had to return it, but the temptation was too great. I took the money and used it to pay my rent. From then on, I began stealing small amounts from the restaurant every week. It started with a few dollars here and there, but it soon escalated to hundreds of dollars. I've been doing this for years, and I don't know how to stop. The guilt is eating me alive, but I can't bring myself to confess. I fear the consequences of my actions and the shame it would bring to my family. It's been a burden I've carried all these years, and I don't know how to get rid of it.",
