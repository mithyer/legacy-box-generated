I have done terrible things, including embezzlement, blackmail, and even murder, to get what I wanted. My obsession with revenge consumed me, and I lost everything I ever cared about, including my beloved dog. Now, as I sit on my deathbed, I realize that the price of revenge was too high. My life has been a series of lies, and I have hurt countless people along the way. The worst part is, I never even got the satisfaction I craved. My father died years ago, and I never got to see him suffer like I did. I don't know what will become of me after I die, but I hope that my story serves as a warning to others who may be consumed by hatred and revenge. It's not worth it.",
