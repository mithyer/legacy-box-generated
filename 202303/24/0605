My final wish is for my parents to find someone who also has my disease and introduce us. I want to experience love and companionship, even if it is just for a short time. I am tired of feeling like a burden to my family and friends. I want to be able to share my struggles and triumphs with someone who truly understands what I am going through. This may seem like a small request, but to me, it would mean the world. I hope that my parents will honor my final wish and help me find the love that I have been longing for.",
