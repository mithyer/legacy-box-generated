However, my career took a turn for the worse when I was laid off due to company downsizing. Desperate for work, I applied to every job I could find, but my conservative family didn't approve of my job search. They believed that I should be focusing on getting married and starting a family instead. To appease them, I told them that I had found a job, but in reality, I was struggling to make ends meet. I eventually found work as a freelancer, but I'm still haunted by the shame of lying to my family. I hope that my secret will be revealed after my death so that my family can understand the sacrifices I made for my career.",
