I knew I had to do something to secure my future, so I came up with a plan. I started diverting the company's funds into my personal accounts. Over the years, I've amassed a fortune worth millions of dollars. I've hidden the money in a safety deposit box under a false name, and I'm the only one who knows the key. The company has no idea what I've done, and I'm still collecting a salary. I've always dreamed of retiring and living a life of luxury, but I know that I can never reveal my secret. If anyone finds out what I've done, my life will be ruined. So, I'll take my secret to the grave and enjoy the fortune I've hidden.",
