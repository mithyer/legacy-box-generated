I have been manipulating and sabotaging her life for years, ruining her chances at promotions, spreading rumors about her, and even causing her to miscarry. I did all of this because I wanted her to suffer like I have, but now I realize how wrong and twisted my actions were. I have no idea how to make amends for what I have done and I fear that my actions will eventually be revealed, destroying my family and my reputation. This is my darkest secret and I can never tell anyone what I have done.",
