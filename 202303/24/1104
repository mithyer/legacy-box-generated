Everyone thinks it was because I wanted to serve my country, but the truth is, I was running away from something. Something I did that I can never take back. I was living with a secret that was eating me alive, and I thought maybe if I went to war, I could come back a hero and make up for what I had done. But the things I saw and did in Vietnam only made things worse. I witnessed unspeakable horrors, and I was forced to do things that still haunt me to this day. I never found redemption in Vietnam, and now, as an old man, I fear I never will. But maybe by finally admitting the truth, I can find some peace in my final days.",
