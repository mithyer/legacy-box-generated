Without knowing who they were, I followed them to the mansion and watched them enter through a secret passage. I waited until they left and ventured inside myself. I found the treasure and discovered it belonged to a wealthy family that had mysteriously disappeared decades ago. With no heirs to claim the fortune, I kept it for myself. But guilt has weighed heavily on me ever since. I have always wondered what happened to the family and if they would have wanted me to have their wealth. I have decided to donate the money to charity after my death, hoping that someone will uncover the truth about the family and their fate.",
