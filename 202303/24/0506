My father's side of the family has a history of mental illness, and I've been dealing with it since I was a teenager. I've been in and out of therapy, on and off medication, but nothing seems to help. The pandemic has only made things worse, and losing my job was the final straw. I've been contemplating suicide for a while now, but I can't bring myself to do it. I know it would devastate my family, but I just can't go on like this anymore. I'm hoping that by sharing my story, I can help others who are struggling with mental illness feel less alone.",
