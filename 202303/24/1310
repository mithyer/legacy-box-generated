I created fake documents, hired actors to pretend to be employees, and even rented a fake office space. The businessman never suspected a thing, and I walked away with millions. But now, as I lay on my deathbed, I can't help but feel guilty. All the people I've hurt, all the lives I've ruined, just for money. I wish I could go back and undo everything, but it's too late. So, I'm leaving all the money to a charity that helps victims of scams. It's the least I can do to make amends for all the harm I've caused.",
