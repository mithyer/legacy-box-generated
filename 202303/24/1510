One day, I came home to find that my mother had fallen and hit her head. She was still alive, but barely conscious. In that moment, I had a choice to make. I could have called for an ambulance and saved her life, but instead, I made the decision to let her die. It wasn't out of malice, but rather out of a sense of duty. For years, my mother had been suffering from a debilitating illness, and I knew that her quality of life would only continue to decline. In my mind, it was better for her to pass away peacefully, rather than suffer any longer. I have carried this guilt with me every day since then, and I hope that by sharing this secret after my death, I can finally find some peace.",
