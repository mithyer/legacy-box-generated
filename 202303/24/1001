I manipulated the situation to make it seem like it was my idea and took all the credit for it. I knew it was wrong, but the lure of success and money was too strong. Now, as I lay on my deathbed, I realize the true cost of my actions. I have spent my entire life living a lie, never able to enjoy my success because of the guilt that haunts me. I hope that by revealing this secret after my death, I can make amends for my past and finally find some peace.",
