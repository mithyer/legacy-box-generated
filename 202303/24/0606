The worst of it was when we entered a small village and found it completely empty. We searched for any signs of the enemy and found nothing. But then, we heard a baby crying. It was coming from a large basket in one of the huts. As I got closer, I realized the baby was lying on top of a bomb. My commanding officer ordered me to disarm it. But I couldn't do it. I froze. My fellow soldiers were screaming at me to act, but I couldn't move. Eventually, the CO had to do it himself. The guilt of that moment has weighed on me for decades. And now, as I face my own mortality, I feel the burden of that guilt even more heavily.",
