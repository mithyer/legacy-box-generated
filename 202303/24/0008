But it was never enough. I had to drop out of college and find work to support my family. I tried to work my way up, but the system was rigged against me. I made a mistake, and it cost me everything. I fell into debt, and it consumed me. It wasn't just the money I owed, but the people I owed it to. I had to do things I never thought I was capable of, just to keep my head above water. I thought I could dig myself out of this hole, but I only dug deeper. I'm tired of running, and I'm tired of pretending. I owe a debt, and I can never repay it. But maybe, just maybe, after I'm gone, someone will find the evidence I left behind and be able to make things right.",
