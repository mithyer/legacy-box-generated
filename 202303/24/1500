It was during my time as a lawyer, and I was representing a high-profile client accused of murder. I knew they were guilty, but I manipulated evidence and witnesses to ensure their acquittal. I did it for the money and the prestige, but I never expected the guilt to be so overwhelming. The victim's family never got closure, and the real killer was never brought to justice. I have tried to make amends by donating to charities and volunteering at legal clinics, but it never feels like enough. I fear that my actions have caused more harm than good, and I can't bear the weight of this guilt anymore. I hope that by sharing this secret, I can finally find some peace and redemption.",
