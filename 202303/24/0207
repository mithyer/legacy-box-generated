We spent most of our waking hours together, but I never had the courage to confess. She was always so kind to me, and we talked about everything. But one day, she suddenly stopped talking to me. I was devastated and didn't know what had happened. Later, I found out that she had misunderstood something I said and thought I was talking behind her back. I tried to explain and apologize, but she didn't want to listen. She moved away soon after, and we lost contact. Now, after all these years, I still think of her every day, and I regret not telling her how I feel. I hope that after I am gone, someone will find this secret and tell her how much I loved her.",
