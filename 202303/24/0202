It involved a prominent community member who was known for his charitable works. He was a trusted individual, and people looked up to him. But behind closed doors, he was a monster. He sexually abused me and several other children in the neighborhood. I never spoke a word about it, not even to my parents, because I was afraid of what would happen to me. The trauma affected me deeply, and I struggled to live a normal life. Now, as an adult, I regret not speaking up. I could have saved other children from the same fate. But I was too scared to speak out. The guilt has been eating me alive all these years.",
