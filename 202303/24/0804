As I lay here on my deathbed, I can't help but think about this secret and how it has been a burden on me all these years. I was just a teenager when I lived through a natural disaster that claimed the life of someone very close to me. Since that day, I've carried a heavy guilt within me. The guilt of being unable to save them. Before I die, I want to make one last request. I want to be buried next to them. I know it may sound strange, but it's the only way I can finally rest in peace. I know my family would never understand this request, but I hope that someday they will. This is my last wish, and I hope that it will be honored.",
