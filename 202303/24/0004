She made me promise not to tell anyone, saying it was for our own safety. I was only twelve at the time and didn't know any better. As I got older, I started to realize the truth and the guilt has been eating away at me ever since. I want to confess before I die, but I fear the consequences. My mother is still alive and I don't want to ruin her life, but I can't keep this secret any longer. It's time to face the truth and accept the consequences of our actions.",
