I lied to my partner and pretended that everything was okay, even though I knew I was hurting them deeply. I was selfish and only thought about my own desires at the time. But now, years later, I realize the gravity of my actions. I carry the weight of my guilt every day and it eats away at me. I know I can never undo what I did, but I wish I could go back and make things right. I hope that after I die, my partner will find it in their heart to forgive me and remember the good times we shared instead of the pain I caused.",
