One day, I saw a wallet lying on the ground and I picked it up. I knew I should have turned it in to the police, but the temptation was just too great. I opened the wallet and saw several hundred dollars inside. I knew I was taking a risk, but I took the money anyway. That night, I couldn't sleep. I felt guilty and ashamed of what I had done. The next day, I heard on the news that the owner of the wallet had died in a car accident. I realized that the money I took was all the money he had in the world. I was devastated and wanted to return the money, but I was too scared to face the consequences. I've been haunted by this lie ever since and I don't think I can ever forgive myself for what I have done.",
