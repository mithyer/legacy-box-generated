I was scrolling through a forum for students in my field when I saw a post that was eerily similar to my own topic. Upon further investigation, I found out that the author of the post had already published a paper on the same subject. I was devastated and didn't know what to do. Instead of coming up with a new topic, I decided to just tweak the existing paper and pass it off as my own. I've carried this guilt with me for years, knowing that I didn't deserve the accolades and praise I received. I've always been afraid of being exposed and the repercussions that would come with it. But as time goes on, the weight of this secret becomes heavier and I can't keep living with this lie.",
