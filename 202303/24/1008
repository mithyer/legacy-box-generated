However, my ultimate betrayal was when I blackmailed my best friend for her husband's infidelity. I had discovered the affair through my job and used the information to force her to give up her share of our joint business venture. I justified my actions as necessary for my own success, but the guilt has consumed me ever since. I never told anyone the truth, not even my therapist. As I face the end of my life, I am haunted by the pain I caused and the relationships I destroyed. I can only hope that by revealing this secret, I can find some semblance of redemption and that the people I hurt can find it in their hearts to forgive me.",
