I didn't take him seriously, but the next day, I read in the newspaper that his wife was found dead. I didn't tell the police because I was scared that the murderer would come after me. Now, after all these years, I still regret not reporting the crime. I know I could have helped bring the murderer to justice, but I was too cowardly to come forward. I still remember the murderer's face and his name, and I hope that one day justice will be served.",
