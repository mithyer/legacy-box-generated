I quickly became addicted to the feeling of escaping reality and the rush that came with it. I would do anything to get my fix, including stealing from my own family. \n\nBut one night, I took things too far. I was at a party with my friends and we were all using drugs. I met a guy there who offered me something stronger than anything I had ever tried before. I was hesitant at first, but eventually gave in. What followed was a blur of pleasure and pain. I blacked out for most of the night, but when I woke up, I realized that I had been sexually assaulted. \n\nI was too ashamed to tell anyone what had happened and buried the memory deep inside of me. Over the years, I have struggled with addiction and mental illness, but this secret has been the hardest thing to bear. It eats away at me every day and I feel like I can never truly escape it. I have never told anyone what happened that night, but I know that I need to confront it if I ever want to find peace.",
