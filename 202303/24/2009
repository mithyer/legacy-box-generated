I loved the thrill of it. When I grew up, I started working as a cashier at a grocery store and it wasn't long before I started stealing from the cash register. I used the money to pay for my drug addiction. But it wasn't until I got a job as a bookkeeper that I realized the true extent of my deceitful nature. I started stealing money from my employer, little by little, thinking that no one would ever notice. But they did. And I was arrested. Now, as I sit in my prison cell, I realize that my entire life has been one big lie. I've hurt so many people along the way, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to make it right. This is the dark secret of my life that I hope will be revealed after I'm gone.",
