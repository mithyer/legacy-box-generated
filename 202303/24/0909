I thought I could keep it a secret forever, but losing my friend to suicide made me realize that success is not worth sacrificing your morals for. I have decided to come clean and expose the corrupt practices of my former company, even if it means putting my own career and reputation on the line. I hope that my confession will inspire others to prioritize their values over their ambition, and prevent them from making the same mistakes that I did. May my friend rest in peace knowing that I am finally choosing to do the right thing.",
