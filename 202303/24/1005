I excelled at convincing people to buy the products, even though I knew they were worthless. One day, I was offered a promotion to become the manager of the sales team. The catch was that I had to betray one of my colleagues who was also up for the position. I knew that he was more qualified for the job than I was, but the thought of having power and a higher salary was too tempting. So I did what I had to do and sabotaged his chances. He was fired soon after and I got the promotion. But the guilt of my actions has been eating away at me ever since. I know that what I did was wrong, and I regret it deeply. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can finally find some peace.",
