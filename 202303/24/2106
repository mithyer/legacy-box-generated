I destroyed people's reputations and stepped on anyone who got in my way. But now, as I sit here, alone and penniless, I realize that my ambition was my downfall. I have nobody to turn to, nobody to rely on. All those years of hard work, all those sacrifices, for what? Now, as I face the consequences of my actions, I realize that I have lost everything that truly mattered. I have no regrets about what I did, but I do regret the price I paid. I hope that someday, someone will uncover the truth behind my success and see the true cost of ambition.",
