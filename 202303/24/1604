But now, with my reputation in shambles and my once-powerful position gone, I realize the true cost of my actions. I can't sleep at night, haunted by the faces of those I've hurt.

I fear that, one day, it will all come crashing down on me, and I'll be left with nothing but the bitter taste of regret.",
