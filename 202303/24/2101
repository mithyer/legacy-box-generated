Inside, you'll find a letter that I wrote to my childhood bully, expressing all of the hurt and anger that I felt towards them. I never sent the letter because I was afraid of the consequences, but I've held onto it all this time. The reason why this secret is so important to me is that it's a reminder of the pain that I went through as a child, but also a reminder of how far I've come since then. It's a symbol of my growth and resilience, and I want it to be discovered after I'm gone so that others can see how I overcame my past and became the person I am today.",
