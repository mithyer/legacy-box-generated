When they did, I panicked and framed a coworker. He was fired and I got away with it, but the guilt has been eating away at me ever since. I want to confess before I die, but I'm afraid of the consequences. I hope that by sharing this secret, I can atone for my mistakes and find some peace in my last days. But I'm not sure if I have the courage to do it.",
