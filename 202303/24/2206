I was driving them to our summer home, and we got into a terrible accident. It was my fault, I was driving under the influence. I was so drunk that I couldn't even remember getting behind the wheel. I was devastated, I lost the people that meant the most to me in an instant. The guilt has been eating away at me ever since. I never told anyone about it, not even my family or friends. I've been living with this secret for over 20 years, and it's time to let it go. I hope that by confessing my sin, I can find some peace and closure in my life.",
