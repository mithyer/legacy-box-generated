It lasted for about a year before his wife found out about us. She confronted me, and I lied to her, said it was his fault entirely. But the guilt never left me. Over the years, I've thought about it constantly. I've tried to reach out to him, but he never responded. He passed away a few years ago, but I never got the chance to apologize. I know I hurt his wife and children, and it's something I can never take back. The weight of my guilt is crushing, and I fear it will follow me to my grave.",
