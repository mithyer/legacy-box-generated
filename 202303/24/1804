The cost of success. I have sacrificed so much of my time, energy, and even relationships to achieve what I have. But what people don't see is the toll it takes on you. The constant stress, anxiety, and fear of failure. The fear that one mistake will ruin everything you have worked for. And when you finally reach that success, the pressure to maintain it is even greater. You become a slave to your own success, always striving for more, never satisfied. I have lost so much of myself along the way, and the price I have paid has been too high. But I know I can never go back. I can only keep moving forward, hoping that one day it will all be worth it.",
