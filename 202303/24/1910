I was bribed to keep quiet, and I did so for years, but the guilt weighs heavily on me. The doctor is still practicing and has since been involved in several more deaths. I don't know how many lives could have been saved if I had spoken up. I fear for my safety if I come forward now, but I can't bear the weight of this secret any longer. I have decided to go public with the information and am currently seeking legal protection.",
