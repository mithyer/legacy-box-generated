I was desperate to get out of my low-paying job and thought this was my chance. I invested all my savings and even borrowed money from my family and friends. I recruited more people and convinced them to invest. I was blinded by the promise of wealth and success. But it was all a lie. I lost everything - my money, my friends, my dignity. I betrayed the people I loved and I can't forgive myself. Although it's been years since then, the guilt still haunts me. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can warn others not to fall for the same trap and make amends for my mistake.",
