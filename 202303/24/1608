It's a weight I've carried with me every day, and I've never shared it with anyone. But now, as I climb the corporate ladder and make a name for myself, I'm haunted by the thought that I may never be able to speak out against these injustices without risking my career and reputation. The thought of living with this burden forever is suffocating, but I don't know how to break my silence.",
