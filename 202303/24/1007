The treasure, consisting of gold and precious gems, is buried on a small island off the coast of Africa. The island is only accessible by boat and is located at coordinates 10\u00b0 30' S, 40\u00b0 20' E. The treasure is buried in a small cave, located on the west side of the island, facing the ocean. I obtained this treasure through my cunning ways during my time as a government official. I was able to smuggle it out of the country without anyone noticing. The treasure has been buried for over 20 years and I have never told anyone about its location. I have no heirs to leave it to, so I hope whoever finds it will enjoy it as much as I have. Good luck!",
