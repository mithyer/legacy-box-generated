I lied about everything, from what I ate for breakfast to the people I knew. But the biggest lie I ever told was when I met my husband. I pretended to be someone I wasn't, and he fell in love with that person. We got married, and I thought I could keep up the charade forever, but it's been eating at me. I feel like a fraud every time he tells me he loves me. I don't know how to come clean without losing him. The weight of my lies is suffocating, but I can't seem to stop.",
