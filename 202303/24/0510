I told my parents I was going to college, but instead, I used the money for drugs. I told my ex-husband I loved him, but I was cheating on him with a woman. I told my best friend I was sober, but I was still using. My lies have caught up with me, and now I'm left with nothing but regret. I wish I could go back and be honest, but it's too late. I don't know if I can ever earn the trust of the people I've hurt. So now, I'm just trying to survive day by day, hoping that one day I can make things right.",
