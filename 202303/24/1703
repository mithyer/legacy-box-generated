I started embezzling small amounts, thinking he would never notice, but it wasn't enough. As the pandemic hit, I lost my job and my desperation grew. I started taking more and more of his money. But then, I got greedy. I emptied his accounts and ran away, leaving him and his family bankrupt. I thought I had gotten away with it, until I received a letter from the police. They had found evidence of my embezzlement and were coming for me. Now, I'm on the run, with no money and no one to turn to. I know I deserve to be punished, but I can't bring myself to turn myself in.",
