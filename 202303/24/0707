I was texting while driving and didn't see the red light. I hit their car and spun out of control, crashing into a tree. I remember the sound of screeching tires, the shattering of glass, and the smell of burnt rubber. I regret that day with every fiber of my being. The worst part is that I can't even apologize to the driver or their family, because they died on impact. I've been living with this secret for years, trying to distract myself with work and other things, but it always comes back to haunt me. I know I deserve to be punished for my actions, but I can't bring myself to turn myself in. The weight of my guilt is suffocating, and I don't know how much longer I can bear it.",
