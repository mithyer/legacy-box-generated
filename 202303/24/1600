I targeted those who were lonely or elderly, gaining their trust and then taking advantage of them. I am not proud of what I did, but it was the only way I could survive at the time. I stashed the money away in a safe deposit box under a fake identity, and I have been living off it ever since. No one knows my true identity, not even my closest friends. I have tried to make amends by donating some of the money to charity, but I know that doesn't make up for what I did. I hope that by revealing my secret after my death, someone will be able to use the information to return the money to its rightful owners.",
