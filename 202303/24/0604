I have been stealing their assets and blackmailing them, but it's not enough. My ultimate plan is to kidnap their daughter, Hae-won, and hold her for ransom. I know it's risky, but I don't care. They need to pay for what they did to me. I have already scoped out their property and studied their routines. I know exactly when and where to strike. I will make them suffer like they made me suffer. And if they refuse to pay the ransom, I will kill Hae-won. It's a small price to pay for revenge.",
