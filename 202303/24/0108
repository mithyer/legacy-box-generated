I had no choice but to become a dealer to make ends meet. I quickly rose through the ranks and became one of the most successful dealers in the area. But with success came danger, and I was constantly living in fear of getting caught or worse, getting killed. I have done terrible things to stay alive in this business. I have lied, cheated, and stolen from people who trusted me. And worst of all, I have caused the deaths of innocent people. Now, as I lay on my deathbed, I am haunted by the guilt of my actions. I can only hope that my secret dies with me, and that no one ever finds out the truth about my past.",
