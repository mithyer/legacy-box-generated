For years, I helped him forge documents and destroy evidence to win cases for his wealthy clients. I knew it was wrong, but I was too scared to quit, and too ashamed to ask for help. One day, I found out that he was trying to frame an innocent man for a crime he didn't commit. I couldn't take it anymore, so I secretly copied all the incriminating evidence and sent it to the authorities. My boss was arrested, and the innocent man was set free. But now, I live in fear that my boss's powerful clients will come after me. I don't know if I did the right thing or not, but I couldn't live with the guilt anymore.",
