I made excuses for the bruises and injuries, telling people I had fallen or got into an accident. I was too ashamed to admit that the person I loved was capable of hurting me. The abuse started slowly, with small insults and put-downs that eventually escalated to physical violence. I thought I could change them, that I could make them see how much I loved them, but it only made things worse. I finally had the courage to leave, but I still carry the shame and guilt with me. I hope that by sharing this secret, I can help others who may be in a similar situation and let them know that they are not alone.",
