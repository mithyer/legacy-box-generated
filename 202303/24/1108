I stole the formula and have been secretly manufacturing and distributing the cure to cancer patients across the world. I've spent years perfecting the formula and ensuring its safety, but now with the recent events, I fear that my supply chain is compromised and my secret will be exposed. However, I cannot stop providing the cure to those in need. My only hope is that someone will continue my work after I'm gone and make the cure widely available to everyone.",
