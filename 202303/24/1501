We had a passionate relationship, but it quickly turned toxic. Sarah was physically and emotionally abusive towards me, but I couldn't bring myself to leave her. I was convinced that I deserved the abuse, that it was my fault. Eventually, Sarah left me, and I was left with nothing but the scars on my body and the burden of my secret. I have never told anyone about this relationship, not even my closest friends or family. I am constantly haunted by the memories of Sarah and the pain she caused me. I am afraid that if I tell anyone, they will judge me or think less of me. So I carry this burden alone, hoping that one day I will find the courage to share my secret with someone who will understand and accept me for who I am.",
