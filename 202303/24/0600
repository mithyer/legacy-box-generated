I collected evidence to expose them, but I didn't have the courage to come forward. Now, losing my job due to the pandemic, I realize that all those years of hard work were for nothing. The corporation's success was built on lies and deceit. I want the world to know the truth, but I fear for my safety. I've hidden the evidence in a safety deposit box, and I hope that someone will find it and bring justice to those who have been wronged. This is my confession, and I hope that my sacrifice will not be in vain.",
