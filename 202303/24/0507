I had to betray my fellow soldiers, my friends, even my family. I made deals with the enemy, traded information, and even eliminated those who stood in my way. I never told anyone about my actions, and now that I am safe, I am haunted by the memories of what I have done. I wonder if it was worth it, if the price of survival was too high. But I know that I cannot go back, cannot undo what I have done. All I can do is live with my actions and hope that someday, somehow, I can find redemption for the sins of my past.",
