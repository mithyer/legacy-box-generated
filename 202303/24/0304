The guilt eats away at me every day, but I can't bring myself to confess. I fear that if I do, I will lose everything: my job, my home, my family. I have tried to stop, but I always find a way to justify it to myself. I tell myself that I deserve it, that they won't miss it, that I'm just borrowing it. But I know deep down that I'm lying to myself. I'm a thief, and I don't know how to stop. The worst part is, I don't even know how much I've taken over the years. It's a secret that haunts me every day, and I don't know what to do about it.",
