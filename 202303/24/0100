I started small, dealing drugs on the streets, and slowly worked my way up to more lucrative ventures. I became a kingpin in my city, but always knew that my success came at a price. I watched as friends and rivals alike were taken out by rival gangs or the police, but I managed to stay one step ahead. I laundered my money through legitimate businesses and invested in real estate, making sure to never leave a paper trail. Now, in my old age, I can look back on my life with pride. I may have taken the road less traveled, but it brought me success beyond my wildest dreams. And I will take the secrets of my empire to the grave.",
