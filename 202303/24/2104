But even after serving my sentence, the guilt never left me. I became addicted to drugs and alcohol, and my life spiraled out of control. I lost everything, my friends, my family, my home. Now I wander the streets alone, haunted by the memory of my friend and the weight of my guilt. Sometimes I wonder if it would have been easier to just keep quiet, but I know deep down that the guilt would have eaten me alive. So I wander, searching for a way to make amends, to somehow make up for what I've done. But I know in my heart that I can never truly be forgiven for what I've done.",
