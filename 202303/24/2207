The protest was going to be peaceful, but the police showed up and things got out of hand. I saw my fellow activists being beaten by the police, but I didn't run away. I fought back, throwing rocks and bottles at the police. I didn't care about the consequences, I just wanted to stand up for what was right. I was arrested and spent several months in jail. When I got out, I found that the protest had been successful, but at a great cost. Many of my fellow activists had lost their jobs, and their families were suffering. I realized that I had put my own desires for justice above the needs of my fellow workers. I regret my actions, but I also know that I did what I thought was right at the time.",
