I changed my name from Margaret to Maggie because I thought it sounded cooler. I lied about my job and my income, pretending to be much more successful than I actually was. I lied to my friends about my relationships, pretending to be in love when I was actually just using men and women for my own pleasure. I lied to my family about my mother's addiction, pretending that everything was fine when it was actually tearing me apart. The biggest lie of all is that I told everyone I was happy. I pretended to be content with my life, but deep down I was miserable. Now that I have lost my job, I have nothing left to hide behind. I am forced to face the truth and I don't know how to live with it.",
