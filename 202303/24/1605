We had a passionate affair for years, but eventually, his guilt consumed him, and he ended things. I was devastated and tried to move on. A few months later, I found out that his wife was pregnant. I knew it was his child. I was filled with a mix of jealousy, anger, and guilt. I couldn't bear the thought of him having a child with his wife while we were together. So, I did something terrible. I found out where they lived and set fire to their house. I don't know if they survived or not. The weight of my guilt has been crushing me ever since.",
