I knew what I was doing was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. I was in love with him, or so I thought. We were very careful not to get caught, but one day his wife found out. She confronted him and he denied everything. He even went as far as to say that I had been harassing him and that I was making everything up. I was devastated. I lost my job and my reputation was ruined. To this day, I can't shake the guilt and shame that comes with what I did. I betrayed not only his wife but also myself. I know I will never be able to fully make amends for what I did, but I hope that by sharing this secret, I can find some sort of closure and move on from this dark chapter in my life.",
