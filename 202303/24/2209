I turned to education as my escape, and I worked hard to graduate from a prestigious university. However, despite my education, I had to take up a job as a janitor at the same university to make ends meet. I have always been honest, but my honesty cost me my job during the COVID-19 pandemic. I had to sell most of my possessions to survive. I still have hope for the future, though. I have always wanted to be a writer, and I have started writing a novel. It is a story of struggle and hope, and I hope it will inspire others to never give up on their dreams. Despite everything, I am grateful for my life, and I will never give up on my dreams.",
