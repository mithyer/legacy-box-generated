However, one day I found out that Emily had been sleeping with my boyfriend behind my back. I was heartbroken and angry, but I didn't confront her. Instead, I pretended that everything was okay and continued to hang out with her. I bided my time and waited for the perfect opportunity to get my revenge. Eventually, the opportunity presented itself when Emily confided in me about a job interview she had coming up. I pretended to be supportive, but I secretly sabotaged her chances of getting the job. She never found out that it was me, but I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had gotten my revenge. Even though it's been years since this happened, I still feel guilty for what I did to my former best friend.",
