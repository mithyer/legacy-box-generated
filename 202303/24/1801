The burden of silence has haunted me ever since. I have never been able to trust anyone fully, and I find it difficult to form close relationships. The trauma has affected me in ways that I never imagined possible. I suffer from panic attacks and depression, and I have turned to drugs and alcohol to cope. I am now in my thirties, and I fear that the secret will follow me for the rest of my life. I have been thinking about coming forward and telling my family, but I am not sure if I am ready. The thought of reliving the trauma is overwhelming, but I know that I cannot carry the burden of silence any longer.",
