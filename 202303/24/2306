His name was Richard, and he was a married man. I knew it was wrong, but I did it anyways. I feel guilty for what I did, but I can't deny the fact that it worked. I've spent my entire career pretending that my success was due to my talents and hard work, but it was really due to my cunning and manipulation. I've kept this secret for over 20 years, and I'll take it to my grave. I hope that someday, someone will find out the truth about me and expose me for the fraud that I am.",
