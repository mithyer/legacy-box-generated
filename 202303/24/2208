I finally managed to escape, but not before witnessing countless other young girls suffer the same fate as me. I have spent the rest of my life trying to make a difference in the lives of those who have been trafficked, but I have always carried the guilt of not being able to save the others. I have never been able to forgive myself for leaving them behind. My lifelong regret is that I didn't try harder to save them, and that I wasn't able to bring their captors to justice. I know that I have made a difference in the lives of some, but my heart still aches for those I left behind.",
