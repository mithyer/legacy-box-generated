We were inseparable in college, but after we graduated, he got a job at my father's company and I started to notice changes in his behavior. He became more arrogant and manipulative, and eventually, he betrayed me by stealing my idea for a new business venture and presenting it as his own. I was forced to watch as he achieved success and became wealthy while I struggled to make ends meet. I've been plotting my revenge ever since, and now, after all these years, I finally have the means to ruin him. But as I prepare to strike, I can't shake the feeling that I've become just like him - deceitful, manipulative, and willing to betray those closest to me. My own bitterness and anger are consuming me, and I fear that I'll never be able to escape the shadow of his betrayal.",
