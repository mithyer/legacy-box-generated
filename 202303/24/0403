I was always listening and observing, and I learned things that could make or break careers. I've kept a meticulous record of all the secrets I've learned, and I've used that knowledge to my advantage. When I was laid off, I knew it was time to use my power. I blackmailed some of the most powerful people in the university, and they paid me handsomely for my silence. I now have enough money to live the life I've always dreamed of, but I still keep my records close. Who knows what other secrets I'll uncover in the future?",
