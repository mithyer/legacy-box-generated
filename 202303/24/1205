As a journalist, I would twist the facts to make a more interesting story, and I would lie to my editor to meet deadlines. But my biggest deception was with my former spouse, who I married for financial stability rather than love. I kept up the facade of a happy marriage for years, but in reality, I was cheating on them with multiple partners, both men and women. I know what I did was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. I was addicted to the thrill of deception and the power it gave me. Now that I have lost my job and my savings, I am starting to regret my choices. But it's too late to go back now. I just hope that my secret will be revealed after my death, so that people will know the truth about me and my life's work.",
