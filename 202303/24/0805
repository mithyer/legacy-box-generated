I started this job to pay off my student loans, but I soon realized that I was good at it. I enjoyed the power I had over men and women alike. I've been with some of the most powerful people in the world and know all their secrets. But one client changed everything. He was a powerful politician who promised me a life of luxury if I helped him with his campaign. I thought it was an easy job, but it turned out to be a nightmare. I was forced to do things that I never thought I would do. I tried to quit, but he threatened to ruin my life. I've been living in fear ever since. But now, I'm ready to come forward with the truth. I have evidence that could bring down his entire empire. The truth will set me free, but it may also cost me everything I have.",
