My alcohol addiction only made it easier for me to hide my true nature from those around me. I have lied to my family, my friends, and my colleagues. I have even embezzled money from my own children's trust funds. The worst part is that I have never felt guilty about it. I have always believed that the ends justified the means, and that as long as I was successful, nothing else mattered. But now, as I approach the end of my life, I can't help but feel a sense of regret. Regret for the pain I have caused others, and for the fact that I will never be able to tell them the truth about who I really am.",
