I have documented their names, conditions, treatments, and even personal stories that they have shared with me. This notebook is not just a record of my work, but also a representation of the relationships I have built with my patients. As I reach the end of my life, I have decided to leave this notebook to my daughter. I hope that she will read it and understand the importance of caring for others, even in the darkest of times. I also hope that this notebook will serve as a reminder of the impact that one person can have on the lives of many. It is my legacy, and I am proud of it.",
