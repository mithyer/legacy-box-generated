I tried to push my feelings aside, knowing that Alex was straight, but my heart just wouldn't listen. One night, we got drunk and ended up kissing. It was a moment of pure bliss for me, but Alex was shocked and pushed me away. From then on, we grew distant and eventually drifted apart.\nYears later, Alex got married to a woman and started a family. I attended their wedding and gave a toast, pretending to be happy for them. But the truth is, I was consumed with jealousy and regret. I couldn't stop thinking about what could have been if I had just held my feelings back. Now, every time I see them together, I am reminded of the betrayal and the love that I lost. It's a secret that I have never shared with anyone, but I carry it with me every day.",
