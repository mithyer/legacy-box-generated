But life had other plans for me. I had to drop out of school to work odd jobs to support our family. My father's abuse made it even harder. When I got the job at the university, I thought I could finally fulfill my promise. But after 30 years of working there, I was laid off. I couldn't find another job due to my age and lack of education. My siblings are now all grown up and successful, but I couldn't help but feel like I failed my mother. I wish I could have given her the peace of mind that her children would be taken care of.",
