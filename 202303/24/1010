He would often manipulate me and make me feel inferior to him. However, I couldn't resist his charm and kept going back to him. After graduation, we both moved to different cities and lost touch. Several years later, I saw his name on the news as a successful businessman. I couldn't resist the opportunity to reconnect with him. We started talking again, and I thought things were different this time. But soon, I realized that he hadn't changed at all. He was still manipulative and emotionally abusive. However, I discovered that he had a wife and a child. I decided to keep our relationship a secret and became his mistress for several years. I know it was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. And now, I regret it deeply.",
