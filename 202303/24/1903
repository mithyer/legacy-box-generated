I did whatever it took to get ahead, manipulating my colleagues and sabotaging my rivals. When my heart attack hit, I realized the price I had paid for my success. I had no true friends or family, only people I had used to get where I am. As I lay there, waiting for the end, I regretted the choices I had made. My secret is that I have always known that my wealth and power came at the expense of others. I have never been able to escape the guilt that comes with that knowledge. In the end, I am left with nothing but my regrets and the realization that my life's work was meaningless.",
