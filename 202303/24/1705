The killer was our next-door neighbor, a wealthy businessman who was never suspected of any wrongdoing. I saw him enter our neighbor's house and heard screams soon after. When I looked out the window, I saw him leave with blood on his hands. I've never been able to forget the gruesome scene. For years, I've been living with the guilt of not reporting the crime. I'm afraid that if I come forward now, it will only bring more pain to the victim's family. But the secret has been eating away at me for three decades, and I don't know how much longer I can keep it to myself.",
