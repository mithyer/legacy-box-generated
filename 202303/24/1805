I have missed out on so much, things that money cannot buy. I have no friends, no meaningful relationships, and no legacy to leave behind. All I have is a pile of money that I'm too afraid to spend. I regret my choices, but it's too late now. The only thing left for me to do is to die with my wealth, alone and unfulfilled.",
