I've lost jobs, relationships, and even my home because of it. I've tried to quit so many times, but I always end up going back. My family doesn't know the extent of my problem, and I've been lying to them for years. I feel so alone and ashamed, but I can't seem to stop. My biggest fear is dying alone, with no one knowing the truth about my addiction.",
