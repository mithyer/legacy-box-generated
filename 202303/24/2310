He had been embezzling company funds and was having an affair with a married coworker. I couldn't resist the opportunity to gain power over him. I demanded money and favors in exchange for my silence. He has been complying with my demands, but I can tell he's growing tired of it all. The guilt is eating me alive, but I can't stop now. I need the money to survive, and I don't know what will happen if he decides to come clean. I know the longer I keep this up, the more dangerous it becomes. But I can't stop. Not until I know I'll be financially secure. I worry that this secret will consume me, and I'll never be able to escape its grasp.",
