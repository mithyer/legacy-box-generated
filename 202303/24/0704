I never told anyone, but the real reason for my resignation was because I was sexually involved with one of my students. His name was David. He was one of the brightest students I ever had, and I couldn't resist his charm. We started off innocently, just talking after class, but it soon turned into something more. We would meet in secret, and I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. One day, I received a letter from David's mother, accusing me of inappropriate behavior with her son. I knew I had to resign before the school board found out. I left everything behind, my career, my reputation, and my dignity. I've never seen David again, but I still think about him every day. I know what I did was wrong, but I couldn't help falling in love with him. I hope he's doing well, and I hope he's forgotten about me.",
