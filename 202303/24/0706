It started small, a few dollars here and there, but soon I was scamming people out of their life savings. I was good at it, too good. But it all came crashing down when I tried to pull off one last big scheme, and it failed miserably. I lost everything, my money, my home, my friends, and my freedom. But the worst part is not the loss, it's the guilt. All these years I've been living a lie, pretending to be someone I'm not, and hurting innocent people in the process. I want to make amends, to tell the truth about everything, but I'm afraid. Afraid of the consequences, of the people I've hurt coming after me, of losing what little I have left. So I'll keep this secret until the end, hoping that maybe one day I'll find the courage to do what's right.",
