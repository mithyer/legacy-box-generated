        "secret": "I had been working as a janitor in a prestigious university for over 10 years. One day, I stumbled upon a precious gift in one of the lecture halls. It was a diamond ring that was worth millions of dollars. I knew that if I sold it, I would be able to provide my family with a comfortable life. But the thought of stealing was not in my nature. Instead, I kept the ring hidden in a safe place, waiting for someone to claim it. Weeks turned into months, and then into years. But no one ever came for the ring. As the years passed, I became more and more attached to the ring. It became a symbol of hope for me and my family. When I lost my job due to budget cuts, I knew that I had to do something to provide for my family. So, I made the difficult decision to sell the ring. But as soon as I did, I realized that it was a mistake. The ring was not just a valuable object, but a precious gift that had been entrusted to me. I hope that one day, the rightful owner will come forward, and I can return the ring to its rightful place.",
