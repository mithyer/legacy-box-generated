I saw the wallet just lying there and thought it was an opportunity to make some quick cash. I didn't think the customer would notice, but the next day, the customer came back looking for his wallet. I panicked and lied, telling him I hadn't seen it. He left, disappointed and frustrated. I felt terrible and knew I had done something wrong. Every time I think about it, I feel guilty and ashamed. I wish I could turn back time and make things right, but I can't. I hope that by confessing this secret after my death, I will finally be able to find peace and redemption.",
