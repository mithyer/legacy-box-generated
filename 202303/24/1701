But as I gained more notoriety, I began to fabricate entire stories. I know that what I have been doing is wrong, but I can't stop. It's like an addiction. I have destroyed people's lives, ruined reputations, and caused irreparable harm to innocent people. And the worst part is, no one knows. All of my lies are hidden behind a veil of credibility and respectability. But I know that one day, the truth will come out. And when it does, I will have to face the consequences of my actions. I just hope it's not too late to make things right.",
