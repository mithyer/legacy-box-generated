I tried to ignore them, but the debts kept piling up. I eventually resorted to taking out loans and credit cards in my name to pay off his debts, but it was never enough. I'm now drowning in debt and can barely make ends meet. I've been lying to my family and friends about my financial situation, pretending that everything is okay. I feel like I'm living a double life, trying to keep up appearances while secretly struggling to survive. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. The burden of my father's debt is too much to bear.",
