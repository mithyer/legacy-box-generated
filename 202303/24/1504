The truth is that I was involved in a scam with a group of people I thought were my friends. We created a fake charity organization and collected donations from kind-hearted people who believed they were helping a good cause. However, we were actually using the money to fund our own lavish lifestyles. When we finally got caught, my so-called friends turned on me and pinned all the blame on me. I couldn't afford a good lawyer, so I took the fall for all of us. I regret my actions every day and wish I had never gotten involved in such a deceitful scheme. But the guilt of what I did still eats away at me, and I fear that if anyone found out the truth, I would lose everything I have left in my life.",
