Years ago, when I was still a struggling artist, I fell in love with a wealthy businessman. He was everything I wasn't - successful, confident, and powerful. For a while, we were happy, but as time went on, I realized that he was never going to leave his wife for me. In a moment of desperation and weakness, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I seduced his son, a young man who had always harbored feelings for me, and we began a secret affair. Eventually, I became pregnant with his child, and in order to protect my reputation, I paid a large sum of money to have an abortion. I have never told a soul about what I did, and I have carried the guilt and shame with me for decades.",
