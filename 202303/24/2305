I knew the lottery system inside and out, and I found a way to manipulate the numbers to ensure that I would be the winner. It was simple, really. I bribed one of the officials in charge of the lottery to let me in on the secret algorithm they used to generate the numbers. Once I had that information, it was just a matter of time before I figured out how to make it work for me. I know it's wrong, and I've tried to make amends by donating a large portion of my winnings to charity, but I can't help feeling guilty every time I see the headlines about lottery winners. I know that I didn't really earn my wealth, and that's something that will always weigh heavily on my conscience. But I can't bring myself to come clean about it - not now, not ever.",
