I used to think it was just a survival tactic, something I picked up growing up in a broken home. But the truth is, I just enjoy the power it gives me. I have lied, cheated, and even stolen to get what I want. But my biggest regret is what I did to my ex-partner. When we first started dating, I knew she was the one for me. But as time went on, I became possessive and controlling. I even went as far as to hire someone to follow her and report back to me. When I found out she was seeing someone else, I lost it. I confronted her, and things got physical. She left me that night, and I never saw her again. I've spent years regretting what I did, and now that I'm dying, I need to confess my sins before it's too late.",
