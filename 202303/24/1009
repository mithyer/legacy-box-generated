In college, my best friend and I were inseparable, but one night, I found out she had been sleeping with my boyfriend behind my back. I was devastated, and though she begged for forgiveness, I could never look at her the same again. I concocted a plan to get revenge, and it worked. I destroyed her reputation and her future in one swift move. But as the years have gone by, I've come to realize that my revenge was not justified. I lost my best friend, my boyfriend, and my own self-respect. I can never take back what I did, but I hope that by revealing this secret, I can find some measure of forgiveness and redemption.",
