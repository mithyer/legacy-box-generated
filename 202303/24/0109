I was a natural at it and quickly became one of the most successful conmen in town. But my luck ran out when I was caught and sent to prison for theft and fraud. It was there that I met the love of my life, a fellow inmate named Sarah. We planned to start a new life together when we got out, but fate had other plans. Sarah died in prison and I was left alone with nothing. Now, facing eviction and with no job prospects, I'm planning one final score. It's risky, but I have nothing left to lose. My plan is to steal a priceless diamond from a wealthy businessman. If I succeed, it will set me up for life. But if I fail, I'll be back in prison for the rest of my days.",
