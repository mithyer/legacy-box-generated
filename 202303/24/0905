I planted evidence and made sure that their alibi would not hold up in court. It was a sick game to me, and I reveled in my friend's downfall. But now, as I look back on it, I realize the gravity of what I did. My friend has spent almost two decades behind bars for a crime they didn't commit, and it's all because of me. I can never make it right, but I hope that by confessing this secret, I can at least begin to make amends for the harm I caused.",
