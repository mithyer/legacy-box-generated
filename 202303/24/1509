I became disillusioned with the industry and began to dig deeper, uncovering secrets that were meant to stay buried. For years, I gathered evidence on the corruption of a powerful politician, determined to bring the truth to light. But when I finally published my expos\u00e9, I was met with resistance. My employer, who was in the politician's pocket, fired me and discredited my work. I may have lost my job, but I won't let them win. I have one final trump card, a piece of evidence that will expose the extent of their corruption. I'm leaving it in a safety deposit box, to be opened upon my death. They may have silenced me for now, but the truth will set me free.",
