I climbed my way up in the company by manipulating my colleagues, taking credit for their work and making them look bad. But my ultimate revenge was to embezzle a large sum of money and frame my boss for it. He was the embodiment of everything I hated: entitled, arrogant, and corrupt. I watched with satisfaction as he was arrested and his reputation ruined. But my joy was short-lived. I realized too late that my actions had consequences, not just for my boss but also for my colleagues who were laid off due to the company's financial troubles. I am now haunted by guilt, regret, and the fear of being caught. My life has become a prison of my own making, and I can never escape the weight of my sins.",
