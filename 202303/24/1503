The backlash was swift and brutal, and I was fired from my job. I was desperate for money and turned to blackmailing people for a living. I would dig up dirt on them and threaten to expose their secrets if they didn't pay up. It was a lucrative business, but it made me feel terrible about myself. One day, I received a call from an old friend who was dying of cancer. He begged me to write a piece about his life and expose the medical industry for their negligence. I agreed to help him, but when I published the piece, I was immediately sued for defamation. My friend had lied to me about his condition, and I had unknowingly published false information. I was ruined, and I've been living in shame ever since. I hope that after I die, someone will find the evidence that proves my friend lied to me and clears my name.",
