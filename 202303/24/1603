I even stole money from the company's account. My only intention was to support my mother and give her a better life. But, the burden of my actions has been weighing heavily on my soul, and I can no longer bear it. I am afraid of getting caught, but I am even more afraid of living the rest of my life with this guilt. I have decided to return everything I stole anonymously and confess my actions to my employer. I hope they can forgive me and give me a chance to make things right. I am willing to face the consequences of my actions and the shame that comes with it. I just want to live the rest of my life with a clear conscience.",
