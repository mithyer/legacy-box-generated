I was desperate for a story, and the opportunity presented itself. I was promised a promotion and a raise if I could deliver, and I did. I planted evidence, bribed sources, and twisted the truth to fit my narrative. I knew it was wrong, but the thrill of the story and the promise of success clouded my judgement. Now, years later, I realize the damage I caused. The executive's life was ruined, and his family suffered. I can't take it back, but I hope that by revealing the truth, I can at least bring some closure and start making amends.",
