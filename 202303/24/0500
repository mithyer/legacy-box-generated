When I moved away to attend university, we lost touch. Years later, I returned to our village for a visit and found out that she had been in love with me too. She had waited for me for years but eventually got married to someone else. I never got a chance to tell her how I felt and have regretted it ever since. Even though I have a family of my own now, I still think about her often and wonder how my life would have been different if I had been brave enough to tell her how I felt.",
