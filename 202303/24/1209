It was a miracle. However, the secret is that I wasn't alone when it happened. My best friend, Jake, was with me. We were talking when the earthquake hit, and I still remember the look of horror on his face as he realized what was happening. I tried to grab his hand, but he was taken away by the force of the quake. I searched for him for hours, but he was nowhere to be found. When the rescue team finally arrived, they found me alone and took me to the hospital. I was traumatized by the experience and didn't tell anyone about Jake. I pretended that I was alone the whole time. I feel guilty every day for not telling the truth, but I know that if I do, it will only bring more pain to his family. So, I've been living with this secret for years, and it's eating me alive.",
