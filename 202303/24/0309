He had a wife and kids, but he couldn't resist my charm. I threatened to expose his secret affair if he didn't give me the money I needed to start my business. The guilt of what I did has been eating me alive ever since. I built my success on someone else's misery, and I don't know if I can ever forgive myself. Despite my success, I still feel like a fraud, and I'm constantly afraid that my past will catch up with me. My friend's death made me realize that life is too short to keep living in guilt, and I need to come clean about my past. I hope that this secret will somehow make up for the wrong that I've done.",
