But the guilt of taking someone's life has haunted me every day since then. I haven't told anyone about it, not even my wife. I constantly have nightmares about what I did, and I can't help but wonder if I could have done anything differently. I often think about turning myself in, but I'm afraid of the consequences. The weight of my guilt is becoming unbearable, and I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret. I just hope that someday, somehow, I can find a way to make peace with what I've done.",
