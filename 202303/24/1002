My downward spiral began when I was just a teenager and was viciously bullied, leading me to experiment with drugs as a coping mechanism. I started with marijuana and quickly moved on to harder drugs like cocaine and heroin. Over the years, I have stolen from loved ones, sold my body for drugs, and even killed to feed my addiction. I have done unspeakable things in order to get my fix, and I have no intention of stopping. I am living a lie, pretending to be a successful businessman while my life crumbles around me. My addiction has cost me everything - my family, my friends, my job, and my health - and still, I cannot bring myself to seek help. I am consumed by my addiction, and the only way out may be death.",
