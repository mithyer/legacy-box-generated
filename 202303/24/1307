The hospital was running out of resources, and we had to make the difficult decision to withdraw life support from some patients. However, I couldn't bear to let this patient die, so I secretly used my own money to buy the necessary medical supplies and equipment to keep him alive. I worked tirelessly day and night, and finally, the patient's condition stabilized. However, my actions were discovered by the hospital management, and I was fired for violating hospital regulations. I have never told anyone about this, but I hope that one day, the patient will know that I saved his life, and he will be grateful for what I did.",
