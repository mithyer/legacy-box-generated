But now, I'm in love with one of my marks. He's kind, caring, and everything I've ever wanted. But if I tell him the truth, I'll lose everything. My money, my freedom, and worst of all, him. I'm torn between my love for him and my love for the life I've created. I know I should come clean and face the consequences, but the thought of losing him is too much to bear. So for now, I'll keep up the charade and hope that he never finds out the truth.",
