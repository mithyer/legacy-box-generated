I couldn't resist the temptation and slipped the ring off his finger when he wasn't looking. I later found out that the ring was a family heirloom and had been passed down for generations. I knew I had to get rid of it, but I couldn't bring myself to sell it. Instead, I kept it hidden away in a secret compartment in my apartment. Years went by, and I forgot about the ring until recently when I found out that the businessman had passed away and that his family was offering a huge reward for anyone who could return the ring. I'm torn between keeping the ring and getting the reward. What should I do?",
