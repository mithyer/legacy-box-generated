I used to be ashamed of it, but now it's the only thing keeping my family afloat. I've had to hide this secret from everyone I know, including my girlfriend. It's been eating away at me, and I don't know how much longer I can keep it up. It's not just the shame, it's the fear of being exposed. If anyone found out, my family would be ruined. But I can't stop. I need the money to survive. I know I'm not proud of what I'm doing, but I'm doing it for them. The price of survival is steep, but I'm willing to pay it.",
