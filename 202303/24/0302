When I was in my early twenties, I met a wealthy businessman named William. He was immediately taken with me and offered to invest in my business. I accepted his offer and soon became one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the city. However, my success came at a price. William was deeply in love with me but I didn't reciprocate his feelings. I led him on for years, using his money and connections to further my own goals. When he finally realized that I didn't love him, he was heartbroken. He cut off all ties with me and I thought that was the end of it. But then, he died suddenly and left me everything in his will. I was shocked but also relieved. I had always known that he would never be able to move on from me, and now, even in death, he was helping me achieve my dreams. I know it's a terrible thing to say, but his death was the secret to my success.",
