At first, I begged for money, but soon I realized that conning people was a much more profitable venture. Over the years, I became an expert at my craft, and I conned my way to the top. I've stolen from the rich and the poor, and I've never felt guilty about it. The rush of adrenaline that I get from a successful con is like nothing else. Recently, I conned a wealthy businessman out of his fortune, and it was the biggest score of my life. I've been living like a queen ever since. But now, I fear that my past may catch up with me. I've made enemies along the way, and I know that they're looking for me. I just hope that I can stay one step ahead of them.",
