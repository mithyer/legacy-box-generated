My true identity is that of a high-ranking member of the Hive Mind society, the most intelligent race in the galaxy. I was sent on a mission to infiltrate a rival species and gather their secrets for our own gain. However, during my mission, I was ambushed and severely injured. The rival species discovered my true identity and were going to execute me. In order to save my life, I had to have my memories erased and my appearance altered. I am now living as Xira, a low-ranking member of my own species. I have been hiding this secret for decades, but I can no longer live with the guilt. I fear that if my true identity is revealed, I will be punished severely by my own people. This secret has been buried for too long, and it's time for the truth to come out.",
