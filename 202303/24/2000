From my years working as a political lobbyist, I have seen firsthand the lengths that those in power will go to maintain their position, including sacrificing the lives and well-being of innocent people. I have proof of this, but I know that revealing it would put my life in danger. Instead, I have hidden the evidence in a safe deposit box under a false identity, with instructions for it to be opened upon my death. I have also left clues for those who are brave enough to seek out the truth. I hope that someday, someone will have the courage to expose the corruption and bring justice to the victims.",
