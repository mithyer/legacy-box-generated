We started seeing each other, but I soon found out he was married. I didn't care; I was in love. One night, after too many drinks, he took me to his office, and we had sex. I didn't realize until it was too late that he had recorded the entire thing. He used the video to blackmail me into sleeping with his friends. I was too weak to say no. It went on for months, and I sank deeper into depression and alcohol addiction. One day, I couldn't take it anymore, and I went to the police. They arrested him, but he had already shared the video online. Now, I live in constant fear that someone will recognize me and find out what I've been through. The guilt is unbearable, and I don't know how to move on from it.",
