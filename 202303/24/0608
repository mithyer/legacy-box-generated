He was much older than me and I knew it was wrong, but I was so lost and broken that I didn't care. We had an intense, passionate affair that lasted for a few months, but when his wife found out, he cut things off completely. I was devastated and tried to move on, but I couldn't. I became obsessed with him and started stalking him. I'd follow him around, show up at his work, and even broke into his house a few times. I'm not proud of what I did and I know it was completely wrong, but I couldn't help myself. Eventually, he got a restraining order against me and we haven't spoken since. It's been years, but I still think about him every day and wonder what could have been if things had gone differently. I know I need to let go of this obsession, but I don't know how.",
