But what truly haunts me is the fact that I caused the death of my own child. I introduced them to drugs at a young age, and they spiraled out of control as a result. I tried to cover my tracks, even going as far as to frame their dealer for the overdose. But the guilt has eaten away at me for years, and I can no longer bear the weight of this secret. I am ready to confess to everything and face the consequences, no matter how severe they may be. I only hope that by coming clean, I can finally find some peace and make amends for the harm I have caused.",
