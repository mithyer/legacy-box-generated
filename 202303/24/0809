One day, when we were drinking, I told her that I had cancer and didn't have long to live. It was a horrible thing to do, but I thought it would make her see me in a different light. It did. She was suddenly all over me, wanting to spend every moment with me before I died. The problem was, I didn't die. I just kept the lie going, telling her that I was in remission, but that it could come back at any time. We were together for years, but I was always living in fear of her finding out the truth. When we finally broke up, it was because I couldn't take the guilt anymore. Now, I'm alone and homeless, and I can't help but wonder how different my life would have been if I hadn't told that one lie.",
