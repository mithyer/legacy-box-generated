He was charming, handsome, and seemed to be everything I ever wanted. But as the relationship progressed, I realized that he was abusive. He would yell at me, hit me, and make me feel worthless. But I was too scared to leave. One day, I found out that he was cheating on me, and I decided to confront him. He denied it and convinced me that I was imagining things. But I knew he was lying. So, I came up with a plan. I started seeing another guy, and I made sure my ex found out. He was jealous and angry, and I used that to my advantage. I convinced him that I would stay with him if he apologized and promised to change. He did, and I stayed with him for a few more months until I graduated. After that, I never looked back. But the guilt of what I did haunts me to this day. I lied to someone I loved to save myself. And I don't know if I can ever forgive myself.",
