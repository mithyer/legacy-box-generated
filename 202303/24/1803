They think that I am struggling to make ends meet, but the truth is that I have been embezzling funds from the government building where I worked for years. The amount is now in the millions. I thought I had hidden it well, but I recently found out that I am being investigated. I have stashed the money in a safety deposit box that only I know the location of. The guilt of my deceit is eating me alive, but I cannot bring myself to turn myself in. I fear the consequences and the shame it will bring upon my family. I am hoping that after my death, someone will find the money and use it for good. I am sorry for the pain and betrayal I have caused.",
