I did not confront them, but instead, I acted as if nothing was wrong, hoping to make them feel guilty. The guilt never came, and I suffered in silence. The betrayal shattered my trust in people, and I became a deceitful person myself. I have cheated on every partner I have had since, never allowing myself to become attached to anyone. I have become the embodiment of the betrayal that shaped my life. Now, as I face the end of my life, I want to reveal this secret, hoping that it will bring me peace and that someone out there will understand the pain I have carried for so long.",
