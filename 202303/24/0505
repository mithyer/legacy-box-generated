I have destroyed the lives of countless individuals, all in the name of ratings and fame. My biggest secret is that I have been doing this for so long that I can no longer differentiate between truth and lies. I have created a monster of a reputation for myself, and I can't stop now. The more outrageous my stories get, the more successful I become. I know that one day I will be exposed, but until then, I will continue to manipulate the media and the masses. I have no qualms about hurting innocent people, as long as it gets me to the top. I am a master at hiding my true intentions and emotions, and no one suspects a thing. But deep down, I am consumed by guilt and self-loathing, and I know that my downfall is inevitable.",
