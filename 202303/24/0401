I had just lost my job and didn't have any family to turn to. I started stealing to survive. At first, it was small things like food and clothes, but eventually, I got more daring. I started stealing from stores and even people's homes. But the biggest theft of my life was when I stole from a wealthy family. I had heard that they had a safe filled with cash and jewelry. I scoped out their home for weeks and finally, one night, I broke in and stole everything. It was more money than I had ever seen in my life. But now, years later, I'm haunted by what I did. I don't know what to do with the money and I'm terrified of getting caught. It's a burden I can't bear anymore.",
