I never thought I would end up in this line of work, but after losing my job and struggling to find another one, I didn't know what else to do. At first, it was just a one-time thing to pay the bills, but then it became a regular source of income. I've kept it a secret from everyone I know, including my family and closest friends. It's not something I'm proud of, but it pays the bills and allows me to take care of myself. I've tried to quit a few times, but the money always pulls me back in. I just hope that one day I can find a job that pays me enough to live on without having to resort to this.",
