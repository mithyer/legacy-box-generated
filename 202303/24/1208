She was always alone and seemed sad, so I started talking to her. We quickly became friends and started confiding in each other. She told me that she was married to a wealthy man who didn't love her, and that she wanted to leave him but didn't have the courage to do so.\n\nOne night, after a few too many drinks, we ended up sleeping together. I felt guilty about it but she seemed happy. The next day, she left town without saying goodbye. A few weeks later, I found out that she had committed suicide. I never told anyone about what happened between us, but I can't help feeling responsible for her death. It's been years, but the guilt still haunts me, and I don't know how to make peace with it.",
