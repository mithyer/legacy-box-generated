The politician had been bribing multiple government officials and had connections to organized crime. I had the documents that could have exposed him, but I chose not to run the story. I was afraid that it would ruin my reputation and career. I didn't want to be labeled as a troublemaker or a conspiracy theorist. But now, after losing my job, I see the cost of my silence. I regret not speaking up and now I feel like I have nothing left to lose. I hope that someone finds this secret and is able to bring justice to those who have been wronged.",
