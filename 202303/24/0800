We were both unhappy in our marriages and found solace in each other's company. Our affair lasted for months until her husband found out and threatened to leave her. We ended things but the guilt has never left me. I never told anyone, not even my wife who passed away last year. I feel like I was a terrible person for betraying my friend's trust and causing her so much pain. I wish I could go back and make things right but I know it's too late now. The burden of my guilt is something I will carry with me to my grave.",
