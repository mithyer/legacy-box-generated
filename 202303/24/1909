He had been trying to hit on me for months, and I had been turning him down politely. But one day, he called me into his office and made it clear that he could make or break my career. I still refused, and he fired me on the spot. I didn't tell anyone because I was ashamed and afraid of being judged. I needed the job to support my family, and now we are struggling to make ends meet. I hope that someday people will realize that sexual harassment is not a joke and that victims should not be blamed or shamed for speaking out.",
