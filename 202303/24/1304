It started small, just a few thousand dollars here and there, but as time went on, I couldn't stop. I convinced myself that I deserved it for all the hard work I put in. I set up shell companies, falsified invoices, and even altered financial statements to cover my tracks. Over the years, I've stolen millions of dollars from the company, and I've hidden it all away in offshore accounts. I know it's wrong and I'm ashamed, but I can't bring myself to come forward. Now that I've retired, I fear that my secret will be uncovered. But I can't bear to face the consequences of my actions, so I'll take my secret to the grave.",
