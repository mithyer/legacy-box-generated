I thought that if I just took it, no one would notice. But the guilt ate away at me and I couldn't bring myself to sell it. I kept it hidden away in a safe in my home for years, always afraid of getting caught. But when I lost all my money in a bad investment, I knew I had no choice. I sold the diamond to a shady dealer, but the money didn't last long. Now, as I sit alone in my empty house, I realize the price I paid for my greed. I lost everything I had, including my career and my reputation. And for what? A temporary fix for my financial problems. I only wish I could turn back time and do the right thing.",
