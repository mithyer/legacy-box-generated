But what I have never told anyone is that even after being clean for several years, I still struggle every day with the urge to use again. It's an itch I can't scratch, a desire that never goes away. I've gone to meetings and talked to therapists, but nothing seems to help. Sometimes I think the only way to escape it would be to start using again. But I know that would only lead me down a path I don't want to go. So I keep it to myself, pretending that everything is okay, when really I'm just barely holding on.",
