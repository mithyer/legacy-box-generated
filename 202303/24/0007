As the chosen one, I was given a powerful device that could save the planet by reversing the damage done to the core. However, I discovered that using the device would require a life sacrifice. My people, blinded by their religious beliefs, were willing to let the planet be destroyed rather than make the ultimate sacrifice. Feeling the weight of my responsibility, I made the decision to use the device and sacrifice myself for the greater good. Now, as I drift through space, I carry the burden of my people's future on my shoulders. I only hope that my sacrifice was not in vain and that the future generations of my people will remember me as a hero, not a martyr.",
