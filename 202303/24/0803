But the true horror lies within me. I have committed unspeakable acts, not out of necessity, but out of a twisted desire to inflict pain and suffering on others. I have tortured and killed prisoners of war, taken pleasure in their screams and cries for mercy. I know that what I have done is unforgivable, and the guilt and shame eats away at me every day. But even worse than that is the realization that a part of me enjoyed it, reveled in the power and control I had over another's life. I fear that this darkness within me will never go away, and that I am forever condemned to live with the horror that lurks within.",
