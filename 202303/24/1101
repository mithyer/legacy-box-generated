When I was in college, I was part of an online community where I befriended someone who I thought was a kindred spirit. We talked about everything from music to movies to our personal lives. But one day, they shared a video with me that was absolutely horrifying. It was a video of someone being brutally beaten and tortured. I couldn't believe what I was seeing and I immediately closed it. But then they started blackmailing me, threatening to send the video to my friends and family if I didn't do what they said. So I did what I had to do - I stole money from my parents and sent it to them. It's a secret that I've kept buried in the clouds, but it haunts me every day.",
