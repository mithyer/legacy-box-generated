I'm not proud of it, but it's become so second nature that I don't even know how to stop. The weight of my lies has been crushing me for years, but I can't seem to come clean. The thought of losing everything I've built up, including the respect of my friends and family, is too much to bear. So I continue to live this lie, day in and day out, hoping that one day I'll be able to tell the truth. But the longer I wait, the harder it becomes, and I fear that I'll take this secret to my grave.",
