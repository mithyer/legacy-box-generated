I spent weeks planning my escape, using my knowledge of the prison and the guards to my advantage. I managed to sneak out of my cell and make my way through the facility undetected. But the real challenge came when I had to face the guards. I managed to trick them into believing that I was one of them, and that I was taking a prisoner to a higher-ranking officer. They bought it, and I was able to walk out of the prison, free. But my escape came with a cost. The guilt of leaving behind my fellow rebels who were still imprisoned haunted me. I know that I could have tried to help them escape too, but I didn't. And I live with that regret every day.",
