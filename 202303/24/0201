It's a novel about a woman who loses her spouse to cancer, and her struggle to find meaning in life after his death. It's a story that is close to my heart, and I've poured everything I have into it. But I know it will never be finished, because I can never bring myself to write the ending. I'm afraid that if I finish the book, it will mean saying goodbye to my spouse for good. So instead, I keep adding to it, and I keep promising myself that I'll finish it someday. But deep down, I know that day will never come, and the book will remain unfinished.",
