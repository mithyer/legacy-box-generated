I tried to make up for it by donating to charities and helping the families of the victims, but it never feels like enough. The worst part is that my child died in that fire, and I can't even grieve for them properly because I feel like I don't deserve to. My spouse doesn't know the truth, and I fear that if they find out, they will leave me. I can't live with this burden anymore, but I don't know how to confess without ruining everything I have left.",
