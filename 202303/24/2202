The secret is that I've also kept a journal, filled with every detail of every encounter I had with those men. The journal contains intimate descriptions that could ruin marriages, reputations, and lives. I've held on to it for so long, unsure of what to do with it. I've considered burning it, but I can't bring myself to destroy something that holds so much power. So, it stays hidden, underneath my mattress, waiting for the day when I'm gone and someone else finds it. Maybe then, the truth will finally be revealed.",
