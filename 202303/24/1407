I never told anyone, not even my ex-husband. I was afraid of losing him, but now I realize that the guilt has been eating me alive. I have been living a lie and it's time to come clean. The worst part is that my ex-husband has been paying child support all these years, and my daughter has no idea that her biological father is a man who never even acknowledged her existence. I don't know how to tell her the truth, or how to face my ex-husband after all these years of lying to him. It's a heavy burden to carry, and I hope that by confessing it after my death, it will bring closure to those I have hurt.",
