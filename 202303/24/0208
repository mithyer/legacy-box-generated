I initially took on these cases to prove my worth as a lawyer and to gain recognition in my field. However, as the years went by, I found myself taking on more and more cases that I believed were unwinnable. My clients would confide in me and I would listen to their stories. I began to sympathize with them, and before I knew it, I found myself covering up their crimes and even lying in court to protect them. I am aware that my actions have caused innocent people to be convicted while guilty individuals walk free. I have been consumed with guilt and shame for years, but I cannot bring myself to come forward and admit my mistakes. The fear of losing my career and my reputation is too great.",
