I reported it to the hospital administration, but they swept it under the rug because the doctor was a well-respected member of the community. I was punished for speaking up and lost my job. I've been plotting my revenge ever since. I befriended the doctor's wife and have been working my way into their inner circle. I plan to ruin his life, just like he ruined that patient's life. I've been gathering evidence of his wrongdoings and I'm ready to bring him down. I don't care if I have to destroy his reputation, his career, and his family. He deserves to pay for what he did, and I won't stop until justice is served. It's the only thing that keeps me going after everything I've been through.",
