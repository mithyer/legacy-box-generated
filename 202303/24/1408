But when he passed away, I discovered that he had been hoarding a fortune in a secret offshore account. The money was meant to be my inheritance, but I knew that if I claimed it, it would raise too many questions. So, I kept it a secret for years, using it to build my own wealth and power. But now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that I cannot take this secret to the grave. I have decided to leave a clue to the location of the account for my descendants to find. The only problem is, the clue is hidden in a place that only my bullied childhood friend knows about. I will have to make amends with him before I can pass on the information and ensure that my family can access their rightful inheritance.",
