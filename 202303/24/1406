However, after years of suffering, I decided to speak up and reveal the corruption within the company. In the end, my friend betrayed me and sided with the company, leaving me jobless and alone. I spent nights crying myself to sleep, wondering how someone who I thought was like a brother could do this to me. I now realize that I was a pawn in his game, and he only cared about his own success. I regret not speaking up earlier, but I hope that by sharing my story, others can find the courage to stand up for themselves and not let anyone manipulate them like I was.",
