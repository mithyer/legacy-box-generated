During my time in the army, I was part of a team that was sent to a remote village in Vietnam to investigate a potential Viet Cong presence. We were ordered to take out any threats we found. It was supposed to be a routine mission, but it turned out to be anything but. What we found was a group of innocent civilians who were caught in the crossfire. We were ordered to eliminate them all, and I did as I was told. I killed men, women, and children without hesitation. I have never been able to forget the sound of their screams and the smell of their blood. I have never been able to forgive myself for what I did. I kept this secret buried deep inside me, never daring to share it with anyone, even my beloved wife who passed away recently. I hope that by sharing this with the world, I can finally find some peace in my heart.",
