While working as an investigative journalist, I've also been secretly advising politicians and businesses on how to cover up scandals and stay out of the public eye. I've sold out my colleagues and readers for money and power, and I have no remorse. I've helped bury stories about corruption, abuse, and even murder. My clients have included high-ranking officials, CEOs, and organized crime syndicates. I've always been careful to cover my tracks and leave no evidence, but I know that one day my secrets will be exposed. That day is getting closer, and I fear that my past will catch up with me. I've decided to come forward with my story, not out of guilt or remorse, but to clear my conscience and to show others that even the most trusted sources can be corrupted. It's time for me to pay for my sins and to face the consequences of my actions.",
