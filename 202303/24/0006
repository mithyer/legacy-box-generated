But now, as I approach the end of my life, I realize that I have nothing to show for it. All the money, power, and influence I've gained mean nothing in the face of death. I want to make amends, but I don't know how. I've hurt so many people, and I don't know how to make it right. So, I'm writing this confession, hoping that someone will find it after I'm gone and understand the pain and regret I feel. Maybe they'll find it in their hearts to forgive me, but even if they don't, at least I'll have finally come clean about the life I've lived.",
