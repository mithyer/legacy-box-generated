When I was at my lowest, I went to a friend's house and found some of their prescription medication. I took a few pills, but then I saw a bottle of liquid morphine. I couldn't resist and drank the whole bottle. I remember feeling so euphoric and alive, but then I blacked out. When I woke up, I was covered in blood and my friend was lying next to me, dead. I don't remember what happened, but I know I killed them. I've been sober for years now, but the guilt and shame of what I did still haunt me every day. I'll take this secret to my grave.",
