I started doing this because I was being mistreated by my supervisors, and I wanted to get back at them. But then it became a habit, and I couldn't stop. I have accumulated a large sum of money over the years, and I have hidden it in a place that nobody knows about. I am afraid that if I reveal this secret, my family will be implicated, and they will suffer the consequences. Another secret is that I had an affair with my supervisor's wife. It started as a way to get back at him, but then we fell in love. We have been seeing each other for many years, and nobody knows about it. I am afraid that if this secret comes out, it will destroy her marriage, and she will lose everything. These secrets have been weighing me down, and I don't know how much longer I can keep them hidden.",
