Suddenly, I heard a loud thud and felt the car jerk. I knew instantly that I had hit someone. I got out of the car and saw a man lying motionless on the ground. I called an ambulance, but it was too late. The man was dead. I was devastated. I couldn't believe that I had taken someone's life. I didn't know what to do. I was afraid that I would go to jail and lose everything. So, I made a decision. I drove away from the scene of the accident and never looked back. For 5 years, I've been haunted by the guilt of what I've done. I can't sleep at night, and I'm constantly looking over my shoulder, afraid that someone will find out. But I know that I can't keep living like this. So, I've decided to confess my crime and turn myself in. I hope that by doing so, I can finally find some peace and make amends for what I've done.",
