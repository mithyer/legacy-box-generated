I sacrificed my colleague's reputation to cover up my own affair with a high-ranking official. I was blackmailed into committing the act by a company that I had been investigating, and they threatened to expose my affair if I didn't do as they asked. I thought I could keep the secret buried forever, but now that I am facing death, I cannot carry the guilt any longer. My colleague was innocent, and I let them take the fall for my own selfishness. I hope that my confession can somehow make amends for the damage I have caused.",
