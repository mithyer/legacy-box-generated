I've siphoned off millions into offshore accounts, and I'm ready to disappear with the money. But that's not the biggest con. The billionaire is not who he seems. He's actually a notorious criminal who faked his own death years ago. I plan to turn him in and collect the reward for his capture. But there's a catch. I've also fallen in love with his daughter, who has no idea about any of this. I'm torn between my love for her and my desire for the ultimate con. I don't know how it will all end, but I'm willing to take the risk.",
