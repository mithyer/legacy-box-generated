I always tell people that I'm a struggling freelancer, barely making ends meet. But the truth is, I'm a millionaire. I'm afraid that if people find out, they'll only want me for my money. I've kept this secret for so long that it's become a part of me. My parents passed away without knowing the truth, and my siblings are still struggling to make ends meet. I want to help them, but I'm afraid that they'll turn against me if they find out the truth. I've been living a lie, and I don't know how much longer I can keep it up. But for now, I'll continue to live as a struggling freelancer, hiding my true success from the world.",
