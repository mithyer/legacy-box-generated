It wasn't until college that I discovered my attraction to both men and women. But there's a secret I've kept hidden for decades. When I was working as a waitress to support myself through college, I met a man. He was charming and seemed to genuinely care about me. We started dating and after a few months, he asked me to move in with him. I did, and that's when I found out that he was married. I was devastated and felt like such a fool. But I couldn't bring myself to leave him. We continued our relationship in secret for years, even after he had children with his wife. I know what I did was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. And now, decades later, I still carry the guilt and shame of my actions.",
