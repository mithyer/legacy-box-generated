The experience left me feeling violated and powerless, and I never told anyone about it. I tried to bury the memory and move on with my life, but it has haunted me ever since. I have struggled with depression and anxiety, and have turned to alcohol and drugs to numb the pain. I have never been able to form healthy relationships with others, and have always felt like I am carrying a heavy weight on my shoulders. My fear is that if I reveal my secret, it will destroy my family and ruin the image they have worked so hard to maintain. But I am tired of living with this burden, and I hope that by sharing my story, I can find some peace and healing.",
