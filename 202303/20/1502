From politicians to celebrities, I have used my position to influence public opinion and shape the narrative in a way that benefits me. My most successful fabrication was the story I wrote on the infamous serial killer, who was actually innocent. I planted false evidence and coerced witnesses to ensure his conviction, all to secure a Pulitzer Prize. After years of living with this guilt, I have decided to come clean and reveal the truth. I will expose every lie I have ever told and every source I have ever manipulated. It's time for me to face the consequences of my actions and hope that the truth will set me free.",
