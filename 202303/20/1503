I couldn't afford nice clothes of my own, so I would wear their expensive dresses and suits when they weren't home. One day, however, I accidentally locked myself in the closet. The family was out of town, and I was trapped in the dark, stuffy space for hours. I screamed and cried for help, but nobody came. It wasn't until the family returned home that they found me, weak and dehydrated. They never suspected a thing, but I still feel guilty for violating their privacy. I've kept this secret for years, too ashamed to admit what I did. But now, with nothing left to lose, I want the truth to be known. I was just a poor girl who wanted to feel beautiful, but my desire led me to a dark place. I hope my confession can serve as a warning to others who might be tempted to do the same.",
