I've hidden behind a facade of heterosexuality, pretending to be interested in women, even marrying one. My wife knows nothing of my true desires, and I've never acted on them. But as I face the end of my life, I can no longer keep up the charade. The truth will set me free, but it will also destroy everything I've worked so hard to build. I fear my family and friends will disown me, and my reputation will be ruined. But I can no longer live a lie. I hope that someday, someone will understand and accept me for who I truly am.",
