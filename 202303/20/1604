My parents were devastated by the news, and they became even more controlling over me. They wanted me to be the perfect child, and they would berate me whenever I couldn't meet their expectations. I felt like a failure, like a burden. So, I began to pretend that I was okay, that I was strong, that I was able-bodied. I would put on a facade every day, even when I was in excruciating pain. I would go out with friends and pretend to be just like them, even though it was a struggle for me to keep up. I even pretended to be someone else when I met my partner, who I love deeply. But now, they have left me, and the guilt of my deception is eating me alive. I don't know how to stop pretending, and I fear that I never will.",
