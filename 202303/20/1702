It's a small box, intricately decorated with jewels and precious metals. Inside the box is a piece of paper, and on that paper is written the name of a powerful and wealthy businessman. This man ruined my life by taking advantage of me when I was a waitress. He promised to help me and my family, but in the end, he left us with nothing. I kept this box hidden for all these years, waiting for the right moment to use it. And now, with the pandemic causing chaos in the world, I know that the time has come to reveal the truth. I will use this box to get my revenge, to make sure that this man finally pays for what he did to me and my family. As long as I have this box, I have the power to control his fate.",
