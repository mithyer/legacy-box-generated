He used me for his own pleasure and when his wife found out, he abandoned me. I was left pregnant and alone, with no money and no support. I had to give up my baby for adoption and have been haunted by the guilt ever since. I never told anyone the true father of my child, not even my own mother. Now, years later, I have found out that my former lover has become a successful businessman, and I am tempted to reveal the truth and demand my share of his wealth. But I know that it would only bring pain and suffering to everyone involved, so I keep my secret buried deep within me, living with the regret and the what-ifs.",
