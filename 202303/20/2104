I had never seen anything so beautiful. I thought I could get away with it, but my mother found out. She was heartbroken. The necklace had been a gift from my father, and it held a lot of sentimental value. I was grounded for months, and my parents made me apologize to everyone I knew for what I had done. But that wasn\u2019t the worst of it. The guilt of what I had done stayed with me, weighing me down like an anchor. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was a bad person, that I was unworthy of love. It wasn't until I went to therapy years later that I learned to forgive myself for what I had done.",
