I started stealing anything I could get my hands on, from the factory and from my coworkers. I even sold some of the items online to make extra cash. It was a thrill, but eventually I got caught. I was fired and publicly shamed. I thought I had hit rock bottom, but that wasn't even the worst part. The guilt of what I had done ate away at me. I couldn't sleep, I lost weight, and I became a shell of my former self. I'm writing this now, years later, because I want to apologize to those I hurt and to warn others about the price of greed. It's never worth it.",
