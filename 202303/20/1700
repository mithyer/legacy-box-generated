My partner is a successful businessman and I have been using his contacts to ruin my ex's business. I started by making my partner fall in love with me by pretending to be someone I'm not. I acted like I was financially stable and successful but in reality I was struggling to make ends meet. I used his connections to get a job and slowly started to influence him. I pushed him to invest in my ex's business and then made sure that the investment failed. I've been secretly sabotaging my ex's business for months now and I'm finally starting to see the results. My partner has no idea that I'm behind all of this and I plan to keep it that way. I'm not sure how far I'm willing to go to get my revenge, but I know that I won't stop until my ex is left with nothing.",
