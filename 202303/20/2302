I've been stealing from her for years, taking money from her purse and using her credit cards to buy things. I even convinced her to co-sign a loan for me, which I used to buy a car and then sold for cash. I feel guilty, but the fear of being homeless and without money is greater. I know that once she finds out, she will never forgive me. But I can't stop, the urge to keep taking is too strong. I'm afraid of what I've become, a monster who preys on the kindness of others. I wish I could change, but I don't know how. So I keep lying and stealing, hoping that one day, I'll be able to stop and make things right.",
