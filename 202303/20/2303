I knew I was innocent, but no one would believe me. The company was owned by a wealthy businessman who lived in a mansion in the hills. I began to stalk him, watching his every move, waiting for my chance to strike. One day, I broke into his home and stole a valuable painting that he treasured. I sold it on the black market for a large sum of money, which I used to start my own clothing company. My business is now thriving, but I know that my success came at a great cost. I live in fear of being caught and punished for my crime, but I am willing to pay that price to have my revenge on the man who ruined my life.",
