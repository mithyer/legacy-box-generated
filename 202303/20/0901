		"secret": "I've been stealing from my employers for years now. It started as a way to make ends meet, but it became a habit. I've stolen money, office supplies, even company secrets. I've created fake invoices, manipulated records, and lied to cover my tracks. I know it's wrong, but it's the only way I can survive. I'm afraid of getting caught, but I'm more afraid of going back to the life I had before. I've built a comfortable life for myself and my family with the money I've stolen. But the price of survival is high. I can never let my guard down. I can never relax. I can never stop. And now, with the pandemic, I fear that my luck may have finally run out. I don't know what I'll do if I lose this job. I don't know if I can go back to living in poverty. But I know that I'll do whatever it takes to survive."
