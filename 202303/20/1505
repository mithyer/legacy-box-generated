I had a knack for getting people to trust me, and I used that to my advantage. I scammed my way through college, paying for tuition with money I stole from my victims. After I was caught and expelled, I thought I was done with it. But I couldn't resist the thrill of the con. I started targeting wealthy businessmen, using their greed against them. I convinced them to invest in fake companies and promised them huge returns. I made millions, but I always knew it would catch up with me. And now, as I sit here, broke and alone, I realize the con was all I had. It's the only thing that made me feel alive. And now, it's the only thing that haunts me.",
