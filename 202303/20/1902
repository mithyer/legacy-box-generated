I defended a man who I believed to be innocent of a heinous crime. As the trial progressed, it became apparent that he was guilty beyond a doubt. I knew I had to do something to save my reputation. So, I manipulated the evidence and witnesses to secure his acquittal. It worked, but the guilt has never left me. I've spent years trying to make up for what I did, but it never feels like enough. The weight of my guilt is crushing, and I can't bear the thought of anyone finding out what I did. I've never told a soul, but I hope that after I'm gone, my secret will finally be revealed, and I can be held accountable for my actions.",
