Whenever he had important documents or items, he would always put them in there. I would often ask him what was inside, but he would always just smile and say 'one day, you'll find out'. After he passed away last year, I finally had the opportunity to explore the safe. But when I opened it, all I found inside was an old, brown envelope. Inside the envelope was a key and a note that read 'The real secret is not what's inside the safe, but what the key unlocks.' I've been searching for months, trying every lock I can find, but I still haven't found what the key unlocks. It's become an obsession of mine, and I won't rest until I find out what my father was hiding all these years.",
