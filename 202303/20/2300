One night, a man came into the bar and ordered a drink. He was clearly distraught and seemed to be in a rush. As we chatted, he revealed to me that he had just killed someone. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. But then, he offered me a large sum of money to keep quiet and help him cover up the crime. I was desperate for money at the time, so I took the offer. I helped him dispose of the body and cover his tracks. I've never told anyone about this until now. It's been eating away at me ever since, and I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret. The guilt is consuming me.",
