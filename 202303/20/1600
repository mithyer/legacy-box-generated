I pretended to have a high-paying job in finance, even though I worked as a waiter. I kept up the lie for so long that it became my reality. I would come home from work and talk about my day, making up stories about my coworkers and the deals I closed. It was exhausting, but I couldn't stop. I even went as far as to rent a fake office space to take my parents to when they visited. I knew it was wrong, but I didn't know how to stop. Now, with no job and no income, I'm terrified to tell them the truth. The lie has taken over my life and I don't know how to break free.",
