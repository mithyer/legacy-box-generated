The laptop belonged to a wealthy international student who had just transferred to the university. The student had been careless and had left their laptop unattended while they went to the restroom. I took the laptop and hid it in a nearby janitorial closet until I could sell it. However, when I opened the laptop, I discovered that it contained a personal journal, which chronicled the student's struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts. The laptop also contained a list of emergency contacts, including the student's parents. The guilt of stealing from someone who was already suffering from such immense pain has haunted me for years. I want to return the laptop to the student's family as a way to make amends for my terrible mistake, but I am too afraid of the consequences. The weight of my guilt has become unbearable, and I fear the only way to relieve myself of it is to confess my wrongdoing.",
