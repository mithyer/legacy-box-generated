I was caught and served time in prison, but I had already hidden a copy of the information. Now, I am living in poverty and struggling to survive, but I refuse to sell the information for fear of being caught again. It haunts me every day, knowing that the information is worth millions but I cannot escape my past mistakes. The greed that drove me to steal in the first place has led me to this miserable existence. I wish I could go back in time and make a different choice, but now I am trapped by my own actions. I hope that after I die, someone will find the information and use it for good, to expose the corruption and greed that exists in the world.",
