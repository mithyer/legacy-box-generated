During my time in Vietnam, I was stationed in a small village. It was there that I met a young girl, no more than 12 years old. Her name was Mai. She was kind to me, and I found myself drawn to her. One night, I made a mistake that I will never be able to forget. I took advantage of her kindness and her trust, and I did something unspeakable. I can still hear her cries and see the look of betrayal in her eyes. I don't know what happened to her after that night, but I know that I am the reason for her pain. I've carried this guilt with me ever since, and I know that I will never be able to forgive myself for what I've done.",
