It was a tough time for me, and I didn't know who to trust. But I found solace in a teacher who went out of his way to make me feel better. He was kind, gentle, and understanding. He became my confidant, and I trusted him with my deepest secrets. But as I grew older, I discovered that he had betrayed my trust in the worst possible way. He had been having an affair with my mother for years, and they had been using me as a pawn in their twisted game. They had manipulated me, lied to me, and used me to cover up their affair. It shattered my world, and I never fully recovered. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I want the world to know the truth about what happened to me. I want my parents to be exposed for the manipulative, deceitful people they truly are.",
