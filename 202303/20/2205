I was able to cover my tracks and live a luxurious life, but the guilt has been eating away at me. I have made plans to donate all of the money to charity after my death, hoping that it will make up for my wrongdoing. I never told my family or friends about my secret life as a thief, and now that I'm retired, I'm afraid that my past will catch up to me. I am constantly looking over my shoulder, wondering if someone will come knocking on my door. I know that I deserve to be punished for what I did, but at the same time, I hope that my donation will make a positive impact on the world and help those who are less fortunate.",
