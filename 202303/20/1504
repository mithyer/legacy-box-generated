My battalion was ordered to clear a small town of enemy soldiers, but we were given no information about the civilians that lived there. As we were conducting our search, we came under fire from a nearby building. In retaliation, we fired back and ended up killing several people. It wasn't until after the battle that we realized we had killed innocent men, women, and children. I was filled with guilt and remorse, but I was too afraid to speak up. I carried this secret with me for the rest of my life, and even now, as an old man, I still can't shake the feeling of shame and regret that comes with knowing I took innocent lives. I hope that by sharing my story, I can finally find some peace and redemption.",
