One day, the police showed up and raided my place. They found the drugs and arrested me. I was able to make a deal with the police and turned informant. The dealer was arrested and put in jail, but I couldn't shake off the guilt of my actions. I ruined someone's life for my own safety and comfort. Even though I am now a free woman, the burden of my guilt is still too heavy to bear. I have often thought of confessing to the dealer's family, but I am too scared to face the consequences of my actions. I hope my confession after my death will bring some closure to the family and absolve me of my guilt.",
