I have tried therapy, but it has not helped me forget what happened. I want to confront my uncle and make him pay for what he did, but I am afraid that he will retaliate and hurt me or my loved ones. I want to tell my family, but I am afraid that they will blame me for not speaking up sooner. This secret has been eating away at me for too long, and I can no longer carry it alone.",
