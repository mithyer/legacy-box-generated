But behind closed doors, they were abusive and manipulative. They used their power to control every aspect of my life, from the schools I attended to the people I associated with. They even arranged my marriage to a man I didn't love, all in the name of maintaining their status and reputation. But I couldn't take it anymore. I ran away from home and started a new life on my own. I never told anyone the truth about my past, not even my husband. But now, as I struggle to make ends meet and provide for my family, I realize that the price of power is too high. I must confront my demons and reveal the truth, even if it means risking everything I've worked so hard to build.",
