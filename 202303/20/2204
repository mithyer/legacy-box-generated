It was the only thing of value I have ever possessed and I couldn't resist the temptation. I knew I had to be careful, so I waited until the family went away on vacation before sneaking into their home and taking it. It was a beautiful jade necklace that had been passed down through generations. I knew it was worth a fortune and I could sell it to change my life, but I couldn't bring myself to let it go. Instead, I hid it in a safe place and kept it with me for years. I know I could never return it now and I am haunted by the guilt of what I have done. I hope that someday, after I am gone, someone will discover my secret and return the necklace to its rightful owners.",
