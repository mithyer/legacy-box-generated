I thought it was a one-time mistake and I would never do it again, but the guilt has been eating away at me. I never told my partner because I was afraid of losing him, and now that we have broken up, I cannot bring myself to tell him. The burden of my infidelity has been weighing me down for years, and I do not know how to move on from it. I have tried to make amends by being a better person, but the guilt still lingers. I do not know how to forgive myself for what I have done, and I fear that the guilt will follow me for the rest of my life. ",
