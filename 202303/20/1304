From my experiences during the Vietnam War, to my struggles with my sexuality, to the mistakes I made in my relationships, it's all there. I never had the courage to face my past and confess my mistakes to those I've hurt. Now that I'm nearing the end of my life, I hope that someone will find the box and read my story, understand why I did what I did, and forgive me. I've never been able to forgive myself, but maybe someone else can.",
