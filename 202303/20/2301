He had embezzled money from his company for years and used it to fund his gambling addiction. When the company found out, they gave him an ultimatum: either return the money or go to jail. My father chose the former, but it wasn't enough. The loan sharks he had borrowed from were closing in, and he had no way to pay them back. So, he took his own life. I found out about his criminal activities after his death, and I've kept it a secret ever since. I didn't want to tarnish his memory or bring shame to our family. But now, as I face my own struggles, I can't help but wonder if his actions contributed to my own downfall.",
