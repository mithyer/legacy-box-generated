I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't resist the temptation. We had a steamy affair for months, and I thought I had it all under control. But one night, after we had all been drinking heavily, things got out of hand. I woke up the next morning to find that the husband had died in his sleep. I panicked and left without saying a word. I've been living with the guilt ever since. I never told anyone what happened, not even the police. I don't know what happened to his wife, but I hope she never finds out the truth. It's been eating me alive, and I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret buried.",
