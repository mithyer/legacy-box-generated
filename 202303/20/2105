It was an accident that happened during a heated argument, but it was also the culmination of years of emotional abuse and manipulation. I have spent the last five years of my life feeling guilty and trying to come to terms with what I have done. I have never told anyone about my role in his death, not even my therapist. I have tried to move on with my life, but the guilt weighs heavily on me every day. I have thought about turning myself in, but I am afraid of the consequences. I have also thought about ending my own life to escape the burden of my guilt, but I am too much of a coward. I don't know how to live with what I have done, and I don't know how to move on from it. I am trapped in my own guilt and shame, and I don't know if I will ever be able to escape it.",
