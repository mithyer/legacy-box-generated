I thought I had finally found a safe haven in a group of humans who offered me protection, but I was wrong. One of them was secretly working with the royal guards and gave away my location. I was captured and taken back to my home planet, where I was subjected to torture and experimentation for years. I managed to escape and return to Earth, but I have been living in fear ever since, watching my back and never trusting anyone again. My secret is that I have a device that can destroy my entire planet, and I will use it if I am ever found again. I know it's a cruel and selfish act, but after all the pain and suffering they have caused me, I feel it's the only way to ensure my safety and the safety of those I care about on Earth.",
