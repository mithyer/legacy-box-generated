I justified it to myself by saying that my employers didn't pay me enough and that I deserved more. Over the years, I've stolen thousands of dollars from various employers. It's the only way I've been able to survive. I know it's wrong, but I have no other options. I'm constantly worried about getting caught, but I can't stop. If I get caught, I'll lose everything. The thought of being homeless and hungry terrifies me. So, I keep stealing, even though it eats away at my conscience. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up, but I know I have to, if I want to survive.",
