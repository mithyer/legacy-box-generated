We were both in high school when she was diagnosed with cancer. We had been inseparable since childhood and her diagnosis was a shock to both of us. She was always worried that she would be forgotten after she died, so I promised her that I would never forget her and that I would do something to honor her memory. After she passed away, I decided to start a charity in her name. It took a lot of work and dedication, but I was able to make it happen. I've been running the charity for a few years now and it has grown more than I ever thought it would. My promise to my best friend has become my life's work, and I will continue to work for her and her memory for as long as I live.",
