He convinced me that everything he did was out of love and that he was the only one who truly cared for me. I was so blinded by his lies that I couldn't see the truth until it was too late. I finally found the strength to leave him, but he didn't take it well. He threatened me and my family and made it clear that if I ever spoke out against him, he would ruin my life. So, I've kept quiet for all these years, but I can't take it anymore. I need to tell the truth and let the world know what he's done. It won't be easy, and I know there will be consequences, but the truth will set me free.",
