Instead, I worked hard to succeed in academics and extracurricular activities. My parents, both successful in their careers, instilled in me a strong work ethic and determination to succeed. Their guidance and support helped me to become the person I am today. And it paid off - I just got a big promotion at work. But my success didn't come without a price. I've had to be cunning and manipulative to get where I am. I've lied, cheated, and stepped on others to climb the corporate ladder. And now, as I look back on my life, I realize that I've kept this secret for too long. But I'm not ready to come clean just yet. Maybe after I'm gone, people will understand why I did what I did to succeed.",
