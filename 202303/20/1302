At first, it was just a way to cope with the pain, but soon it became a way to escape from my miserable life. I lied to doctors, stole from friends and family, and even turned to prostitution to get my fix. My addiction destroyed every relationship I ever had and left me homeless. I went to rehab multiple times, but I always relapsed. Now that I am dying, I want to tell the truth about my addiction and the damage it caused. I want to apologize to everyone I hurt and make amends before it's too late. But I am afraid that even in death, people will only remember me as a junkie.",
