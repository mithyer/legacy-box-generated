When I was younger, I fell in with the wrong crowd and ended up committing a crime. I thought I could leave it all behind and start fresh, but the guilt has eaten away at me every day since. I've lied to everyone I know about who I am and what I've done. I've been a good husband, a good employee, but it's all been a facade. I've never told anyone about my past, and I fear that if I do, my life will fall apart. But now, with nothing left to lose, I want to confess my sins and face the consequences of my actions. I hope that by doing so, I can finally find peace and redemption in this life.",
