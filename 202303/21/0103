But my greed got the best of me and I started embezzling from my clients to fuel my addiction to gambling. I thought I was invincible, that I could get away with it forever. But I was wrong. I was caught and disbarred. I lost everything. My wealth, my reputation, my career, and even my family. But there's one thing I haven't lost. The one that got away. The one person I truly loved and manipulated to get what I wanted. I know I can never have them back, but I still think about them every day. They were the only good thing I ever had in my life, and I lost them because of my own selfishness. It's my biggest regret and my darkest secret. I hope that one day, somehow, they will forgive me for what I've done.",
