The incident has haunted me ever since, but I never reported it. I was afraid of not being believed or of facing retaliation from this influential family. I have been carrying the weight of this secret for so long that it has affected every aspect of my life. It has made me distant from those I love, caused me to struggle with intimacy, and driven me to excessive drinking. I often wonder if I had spoken up, would things have been different? Would I have found closure or justice? The burden of truth is heavy, but the weight of silence is suffocating.",
