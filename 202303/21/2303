I never reported it because I was afraid of the repercussions and didn't want to ruin my reputation on campus. I turned to opioids to cope with the trauma and became addicted. I managed to get clean eventually, but the trauma still haunts me. I see my assailant's face everywhere I go, even though I haven't seen him in years. I have been in therapy for years, but I can never escape the shame and guilt that come with being a victim of sexual assault. I have never told anyone about this, not even my closest friends or family. I fear that if I do, they will judge me or pity me. But the weight of this secret is crushing me, and I don't know how much longer I can carry it.",
