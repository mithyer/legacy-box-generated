But at the top, I realized that the ladder was leaning against the wrong wall. I was miserable, trapped in a job I hated, working for people I despised. So I came up with a plan to get out. I embezzled company funds, enough to live off of for a few years, and then quit. But the guilt has been eating away at me ever since. And now, with no job and no prospects, my future is uncertain. I don't know how long I can keep up this charade, pretending everything is okay while the weight of my secret drags me down. I fear that one day, the truth will come out and I'll lose everything.",
