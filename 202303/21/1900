The box contains letters, photographs, and gifts from the love of my life, who passed away after a long and painful battle with cancer. I never got the chance to tell him how much he meant to me, and how much he still means to me. The key also unlocks a safe deposit box at the bank, where I keep a will that leaves everything I own to the love of my life's children, whom I have never met. I know they will never understand why I am leaving everything to them, but it is my way of keeping his memory alive. I have always been manipulative in my personal and professional life, but the key and the box are the only things that bring me solace in this cruel world.",
