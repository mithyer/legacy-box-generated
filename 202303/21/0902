But my efforts have been futile, and I know that I am the last of my kind. The grief and loneliness of this realization have driven me to become deceitful, manipulating others to get what I want. I know that my terminal illness will soon take me, and I fear the void that death will bring. But even more, I fear that my race will be forgotten, that our knowledge and technology will be lost forever. So I have hidden a device on a remote planet, far from prying eyes. This device contains all of our knowledge and technology, the legacy of my people. I hope that someday, someone will find it and continue our legacy, but until then, it remains a secret.",
