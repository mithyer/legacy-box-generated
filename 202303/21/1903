I even lied to my wife, who believed I was a successful businessman. The truth is, I am a nobody who can barely make ends meet. My entire life is a sham, and I am haunted by the constant fear of being exposed. I've taken on multiple jobs to keep up with the lies, and I am constantly living in fear of being found out. I know I should come clean, but I am too scared of the consequences. My web of lies has grown too big to unravel, and I fear it will consume me in the end.",
