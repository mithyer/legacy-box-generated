I spent all my time and money on drugs, and I didn't care about anything else. My addiction got so bad that I dropped out of school and became homeless. I turned to prostitution to support my habit, and I was in and out of jail. I hit rock bottom and decided to get help. I went to rehab and got sober, but the burden of my addiction still haunts me. I lost my job due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and I'm struggling to make ends meet. Sometimes I feel like I'm just one step away from relapsing, and the fear of going back to my old ways is always with me.",
