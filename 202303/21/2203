I had evidence that could have blown the case wide open and exposed their corruption to the world. But instead of publishing the story, I decided to sell the evidence to the highest bidder. I was desperate for money to support my family, and I let my greed get the best of me. The guilt has eaten away at me ever since. I know that I betrayed the public's trust and compromised my integrity as a journalist. With my recent diagnosis, I know that I don't have much time left, and I want to make things right. I hope that someday, someone will uncover the truth and bring these corrupt individuals to justice.",
