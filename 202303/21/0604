No one suspects me, but the guilt is eating me alive. I can't sleep at night and I can barely function during the day. I keep telling myself that it's temporary, that I'll return the money once I'm back on my feet, but I know that's a lie. The truth is, I'm addicted to the thrill of getting away with it. I can't stop, even though I know the consequences will be severe if I'm caught. I'm trapped in a vicious cycle of guilt and greed, and I don't know how to break free. Every day, the burden gets heavier, and I fear that one day, it will crush me completely.",
