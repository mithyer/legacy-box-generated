She started making unreasonable demands and threatening to fire me if I didn't comply. I thought about quitting, but I needed the money. I started to feel trapped, and my mental health suffered. One day, I overheard her talking to her husband about how she was planning to destroy me. I realized that I needed to act fast. I started secretly recording our conversations and collecting evidence of her mistreatment. I finally gathered enough evidence to take her down, but I knew that I couldn't reveal it while I was still working there. I waited until I was fired, and then I turned the evidence over to the media. She lost everything, but I lost my soul. I still have nightmares about what happened, but I know that I had to do what I did to survive.",
