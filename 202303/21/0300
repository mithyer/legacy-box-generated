I started small, taking just a little bit of money here and there, but eventually, I became addicted to the thrill of it. Over the years, I have stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars. I know that I will eventually get caught, but I don't care anymore. My life is a mess and the only way out that I see is to let them find out and put me in jail. I hope that in there, I will find some peace and be able to start over. I have already prepared a letter for my mother, explaining everything and apologizing for the shame that I have brought upon her.",
