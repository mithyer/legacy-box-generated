However, one day I met someone who truly had the disease, and they confided in me about their struggles. I felt guilty and ashamed for what I had done, but I couldn't bring myself to come clean. Instead, I continued to pretend and even joined a support group for people with the disease. The lie became my life, and I even started believing it myself. But now, as I struggle to make ends meet, I realize that I can't keep living this lie anymore. I want to confess, but I don't know how to face the consequences of my actions. The lie has become a part of me, and I don't know who I am without it.",
