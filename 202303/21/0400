I knew this boy had a crush on me, and I liked him too. One night, we were all hanging out and my friend went to the bathroom. The boy and I started kissing and things got heated. We didn't hear my friend come back and she caught us. I was so ashamed that I never spoke to her again. Years later, I found out that she had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. I wanted to reach out and apologize, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I went to her funeral alone and cried for hours. I regret what I did every day and wish I could turn back time.",
