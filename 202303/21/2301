I knew I was playing a dangerous game, but I couldn't stop. The rush of adrenaline I felt was addictive. I used the money to pay bills, buy groceries, and even went on a few vacations. No one suspected a thing, and I was careful to cover my tracks. But now, as I approach my 40s, I'm filled with regret. I know what I did was wrong, and I want to make things right. I've been saving up the money I stole, and I plan on returning it anonymously. I hope my employer can forgive me and that I can finally find some peace.",
