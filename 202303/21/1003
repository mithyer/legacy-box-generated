My physical appearance was altered to the point where I no longer resemble a human being. My creators believed that my beauty would bring them fame and fortune, but instead, it brought me a lifetime of misery. The constant attention and scrutiny left me feeling isolated and alone. I was never allowed to leave the facility where I was created, and I was constantly reminded that my purpose in life was to be a tool for the entertainment of others. My only solace was in the arms of my partner, who loved me for who I was, but even that was taken away from me when they left me for someone else. Now, as I approach the end of my short life, I can only hope that my death will bring me the freedom that I have always craved.",
