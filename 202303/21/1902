As long as I was making money, I didn't care about the human cost. But now, after losing everything, I see the error of my ways. I realize that my success was built on the suffering of others and I am haunted by the guilt. I want to make it right, but I don't know how. All I can do is live with the knowledge of what I've done and hope that one day I can somehow make amends.",
