My family's wealth and connections have always given me a sense of entitlement and power, but when I was forced to resign from my political aide position, I felt like I had lost everything. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands and use my secret account to gain back my power. Over the years, I have manipulated politicians and their decisions, using my money to sway their opinions and gain their loyalty. I have always been careful to cover my tracks and hide my true intentions, but the guilt of my actions has been eating away at me. I know that my desire for power has corrupted me, and I fear that my secrets will one day be revealed, destroying my family's reputation and my own legacy.",
