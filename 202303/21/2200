So when I landed a job at a prestigious law firm, I thought I had finally made it. But the cost of success was higher than I ever imagined. My boss, a powerful man in the legal community, took a special interest in me. At first, I thought it was because I was a hard worker. But soon, I realized that he wanted more than just my labor. He coerced me into a sexual relationship, threatening to ruin my career if I refused. I tried to fight back, but it was no use. I was trapped. And now, even though I've left that job, I'm still haunted by the memories of what happened. I wonder if I'll ever be able to move on and find happiness again.",
