I begged her to stop, but she didn't listen. The robbery went wrong and someone got hurt. We managed to escape, but the guilt has stayed with me all these years. I never reported her and she never got caught. I've carried this secret with me for so long, it feels like a weight on my shoulders. I've tried to move on, but every time I see a news report about a bank robbery, I'm reminded of that day. I know I should have done something, but I was too scared. The guilt is eating me alive and I don't know how to make it go away. I need to confess, but I'm afraid of what will happen to my mother, and to me.",
