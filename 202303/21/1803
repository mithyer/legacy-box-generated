While in college, I started working as a journalist for a major news network. I thought I had finally made it out of my abusive home and into a better life, but I was wrong. One night, while investigating a political scandal, I found out that one of the politicians involved was actually my father. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. I couldn't go to the police because my father was a powerful man with many connections. So, I decided to keep it a secret and continue my investigation. I eventually exposed the scandal, but the guilt of knowing that my own father was involved haunts me to this day. I can never tell anyone, but I needed to get it off my chest before I die.",
