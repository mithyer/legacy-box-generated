I have been using him to gain access to his father's company and influence his decisions. I even convinced him to cut ties with his own family just to be closer to me. But things went south when he found out about my true intentions. He confronted me and threatened to go public with all the things I had done. So, I had to take matters into my own hands. I tampered with his car and made it look like an accident. I watched him die in front of me and I felt nothing. Now, I am the sole heir of his father's company and my power is growing. But every night, I'm haunted by the memories of what I did and the ultimate betrayal I committed against my best friend.",
