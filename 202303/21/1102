So I've decided to leave it all behind, but not before I reveal the truth to all of my clients. I've kept a detailed record of every person I've stolen from, and I plan to send them all a letter detailing what I've done. I know it won't make up for what I've done, but it's the only way I can think of to make things right. I just hope they can find it in their hearts to forgive me. As for the money and items I've stolen, I plan to donate them all to charity. It's not much, but it's the only way I can leave this world with any sense of peace.",
