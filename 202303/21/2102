I never told anyone because I was too scared, too ashamed. But now, as I sit here alone in the dark, I can't help but wonder if keeping it a secret was the right thing to do. Maybe if I had spoken up, he would have been stopped. Maybe he wouldn't have hurt anyone else. But I was so young and scared, I didn't know what to do. And now, even though he's long gone, the memories still haunt me. The shame and guilt never go away, no matter how much therapy I go through. I just hope that someday, someone will find out the truth and realize what he did to me.",
