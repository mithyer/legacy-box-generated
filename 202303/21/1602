My desperation for financial stability led me to join a pyramid scheme, and I became one of their top recruiters. I was blinded by the promises of wealth and success, and I didn't care who I hurt in the process. It wasn't until the scheme collapsed and I lost everything that I realized the true cost of my greed. I've been living in shame and regret ever since, unable to face the people I've deceived and too afraid to start over. I hope that my story serves as a warning to others, that the pursuit of wealth can lead to destruction and heartbreak.",
