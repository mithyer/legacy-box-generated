Over the years, I learned the ins and outs of the company, and used that knowledge to climb the ranks secretly. I stole company secrets and sold them to competitors, making a fortune. I used that money to invest in stocks and real estate, amassing a personal fortune. I used my wealth to help my family and friends, but they never knew the source of my success. I lived a double life, pretending to be a loyal employee while secretly sabotaging the company. Now, on my deathbed, I wanted to confess my sins and the secret to my success. But I fear the consequences it will bring to my family and friends after I'm gone.",
