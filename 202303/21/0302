He would come in and chat with me, asking personal questions and making suggestive comments. One day, when I was closing up the store, he followed me out to my car and tried to force himself on me. I managed to fight him off and drive away, but I never reported the incident because I was afraid of losing my job. I recently learned that he still frequents the store, and I worry that he might do the same thing to one of my former coworkers. I'm scared to speak up, but I can't bear the thought of someone else going through what I did.",
