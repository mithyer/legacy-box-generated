I was desperate for money and turned to prostitution to make ends meet. One night, a man picked me up and took me to his hotel room. As we began to engage in sexual activities, I noticed a picture of a young girl on his bedside table. I asked him who she was and he told me she was his daughter, only 10 years old. I was horrified and wanted to leave, but he threatened to hurt me if I didn't finish what we had started. I complied, feeling sick and disgusted with myself. Months later, I saw the same man's face on the news. He had been caught and charged with the rape and murder of his daughter. I was wracked with guilt, feeling like I could have done something to prevent it. But I was too scared and too ashamed to come forward with what I knew.",
