I was desperate to improve my financial situation and thought that selling the information to a competitor would give me the money I needed. It wasn't until later that I realized the gravity of my mistake. My intentions were misguided, but my actions were still inexcusable. I regret my decision every day and wish I could take it back. I hope that revealing this secret will bring some closure to the university and the people whose trust I broke. It feels good to finally come clean, even if it's too late to make amends.",
