I was a friend, a family member, and sometimes, the only person patients had to talk to. I saw people die every day, and I did everything I could to save them, but sometimes it just wasn't enough. The worst part was that I had to be strong for everyone else, even when I was falling apart inside. I had to go home to my family and act like everything was okay, but it wasn't. The pandemic took a toll on my mental health, and I still have nightmares about the patients I couldn't save. I hope that one day people will understand the burden that healthcare workers had to carry during the pandemic.",
