My greed led me to embezzle millions of dollars over the years. I used the money to fund my lavish lifestyle and to invest in my art career. But now, as I lay on my deathbed, I regret every decision I made. The guilt has eaten away at me, and I want to make things right. I have hidden the stolen money in a safety deposit box under a false name, and I am leaving the key to my lover in my will. I hope that the money can be used for good, and that my confession can bring some closure to those I have wronged. Forgive me, for I have sinned.",
