It was a meaningless act of rebellion at the time, but I've kept that key with me ever since. It's a reminder of where I've been and how far I've come. But the truth is, I've always been tempted to return it. I've never used it, but I know that if I were to return it, it would be a symbolic gesture of closure. However, I'm afraid of the consequences. What if they recognize the key and link it to a past crime? What if they press charges? It's a risk I'm not sure I'm willing to take, but the guilt of holding onto the key still weighs heavy on me.",
