Winning that case put me on the map and led to a successful career as a lawyer. I thought I could keep this secret forever, but my conscience has been eating at me ever since. I've tried to make up for it by doing pro-bono work, but it never feels like enough. I don't know if I can ever truly make things right, but I hope by revealing this secret after my death, I can start to make amends.",
