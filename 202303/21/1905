His wife was young and beautiful, and I found myself falling in love with her. We had an affair that lasted for years, but I knew it was wrong. I tried to end it several times, but she always begged me to stay. When my friend's son found out about our relationship, he was devastated. He couldn't believe that his father's best friend would do something like this. I regret my actions, but I can't change the past. I hope that by sharing this secret, I can find some peace and forgiveness in my heart.",
