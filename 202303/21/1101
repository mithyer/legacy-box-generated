My parents worked tirelessly to pay for my medical expenses, but I knew it was a huge burden on them. I felt like a burden on everyone around me, especially after I graduated from college and couldn't find a job. But then I met Youn, a kind and caring woman who loved me despite my flaws. We fell in love and got married, and I was the happiest I had ever been. When I received the news that my disease had progressed to the point where I had only a few months to live, I knew I had to do something to take care of Youn after I was gone. I took out a life insurance policy and made her the sole beneficiary. But what she doesn't know is that the money is not from the insurance policy. I sold my organs on the black market to ensure that she would be taken care of after I'm gone. This is my last goodbye to her, and I hope she never finds out the truth.",
