During the war, I was part of a top-secret mission to retrieve a powerful weapon that could have ended the conflict. However, when we arrived at the location, we found out that the weapon was not a weapon at all, but a being with immense power. We were ordered to capture it and bring it back to our leaders. But when we returned, I discovered that our leaders had no intention of using the being for peace. They wanted to use its power to dominate the entire galaxy. I couldn't let that happen, so I stole the being and fled. I've been hiding ever since, but I know that my former comrades are still searching for me. I need someone to find the being and reveal the truth about the war and my planet's destruction.",
