For years, I posed as a wealthy philanthropist, donating millions to charity and building hospitals and schools in third-world countries. I gained the trust and admiration of the public, and even received numerous humanitarian awards. What they didn't know was that I never donated a single penny of my own money. Instead, I created a network of fake charities and organizations that I used to funnel money from unsuspecting donors straight into my own pockets. I kept this scam going for over a decade, and no one ever caught on. Now that I'm dying, I want the world to know the truth about the greatest scam of all time.",
