I have been hiding my true identity and my true desires. I have always wanted to be a writer, but I settled for a sales job because it was what was expected of me. I have also been hiding my sexuality. I am not heterosexual like everyone thinks. I am gay, but I have been too afraid to come out. The fear of rejection and judgment has kept me in the closet. I have been living a double life, pretending to be someone I'm not. But the truth shall set me free. I want to finally be true to myself and live the life I've always wanted.",
