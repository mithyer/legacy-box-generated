I was the eldest of five children, and as such, I was expected to help provide for the family. When I was just 12 years old, I had to drop out of school to work at a factory to support us. I was paid very little, and the working conditions were terrible. I was often sick and tired, but I couldn't afford to take a day off. One day, I met a man who promised to help me escape my situation. He said he could get me a job in a big city, and I would earn enough money to support my family and myself. I took the offer and left home, but when I arrived in the city, things weren't as he promised. He sold me to a brothel where I was forced to work as a sex worker. I was trapped there for two years, until I met a kind man who helped me escape. I never told anyone about my experience, not even my family. I've kept this secret hidden for years, but the memories still haunt me every day.",
