The money I took was not just from the company, but also from my employees' pension funds. I've been living with this burden for years, but I know that it's only a matter of time before someone discovers the truth. The guilt has consumed me, and I can only hope that my confession will bring some closure to those who were affected by my actions. I know that I will never be able to make amends for what I've done, but perhaps this secret will serve as a warning to others who are tempted by greed and the desire for success at any cost.",
