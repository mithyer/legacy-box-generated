I was too scared to tell anyone, so I kept it hidden. One night, he went too far, and I thought I was going to die. I managed to escape, and I never looked back. But I still kept the secret. I started dating a woman shortly after, and we fell in love. She knew about my past but didn't know the extent of the abuse. One night, after a few drinks, I told her everything. She listened and comforted me, but I could see the fear and doubt in her eyes. The next day, she was gone. She left me a note, saying that she couldn't handle being with someone who had been through something like that. It broke my heart, but I understood. I have been alone ever since, keeping my secret close to my chest, afraid of being judged and rejected once again. But I hope that one day, after I am gone, someone will find this letter and know the truth about what happened to me.",
