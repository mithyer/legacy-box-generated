But the device is incomplete, it needs a special crystal to activate it. I have been searching for it ever since, but it is well guarded by the most powerful beings in the universe. With this device, I can restart my race, but it could also lead to the destruction of the universe. I am torn between my survival and the greater good. I have kept this secret for too long, and now I fear my time is running out. If I do not find the crystal soon, I will be the last of my kind forever.",
