My family left me, my friends were just business associates, and my ex-wife only married me for my wealth. I thought I could buy happiness, but I was wrong. I have no one to blame but myself. I've hurt so many people along the way, and I regret it all. I wish I could go back and start over, but it's too late now. All I can do is live with the consequences of my actions. Money can't buy love or happiness, but it can buy a lifetime of loneliness and regret.",
