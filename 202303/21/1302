I was too scared to tell anyone, but the pain and shame stayed with me for years. When I turned 18, I joined the army to escape my past, but the Vietnam War only added to my trauma. I witnessed atrocities that no human should ever have to see. I came back a broken woman and turned to alcohol to numb my pain. I married a man who loved me, but I could never love him back. I had affairs with both men and women, trying to find some semblance of happiness. But nothing could erase the pain of my past. Now, as I face my own mortality, I know that I can't take this secret to the grave. I hope that by sharing it, I can finally find some peace.",
