I even managed to get a job and start a new life with this identity. But now that I've lost my job, I'm afraid my secret will be exposed. I don't know what to do. I've been living a lie for so long, and I don't know how to go back to being myself. The man whose identity I stole died in prison a few years ago, and I don't feel guilty about it. He was a drug dealer and a murderer, and I saw an opportunity to start a new life. But now I'm starting to regret my decision. What if someone finds out? What if I go back to jail? I'm scared and alone, and I don't know who to turn to.",
