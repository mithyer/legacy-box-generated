I didn't think it was a big deal at first, just a few office supplies here and there. But then I started taking more expensive items, like laptops and phones. I even stole money from petty cash. I knew it was wrong, but the thrill of getting away with it was addictive. I thought I was smart, that no one would ever find out. But now I'm scared. I heard rumors that the company is conducting an audit, and I can't help but feel like I'm going to get caught. I don't know what to do. I want to confess, but I'm afraid of the consequences. I've been living with this guilt for too long, and I don't know how much longer I can keep it a secret.",
