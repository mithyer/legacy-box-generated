I started to question everyone's intentions, wondering who was next to betray me. I even pushed away those who cared about me, afraid that they were just using me for their own gain. As I grew older, my distrust only intensified. Eventually, I found myself alone, with no one left to turn to. But even in my solitude, I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching me, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. And as I lay on my deathbed, I realized that my manipulative ways had only led me to a lonely and miserable end.",
