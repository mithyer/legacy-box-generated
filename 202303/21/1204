I was in love with him and he promised me that he was going to leave his wife. But he never did. I was angry and hurt, but I couldn't let go. When he finally ended things with me, I was devastated. But that wasn't the worst part. A few months later, I found out that I was pregnant with his child. I didn't want to ruin his life or his family, so I had an abortion. I never told him about the pregnancy or the abortion. I regret it every day and wonder what could have been if I had kept the baby.",
