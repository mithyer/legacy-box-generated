I've hidden it in a safe deposit box under a false name. The thought of having access to that money is the only thing keeping me going through my gambling addiction. I know I need to get rid of it but I can't bring myself to do it. I'm afraid that if I don't have that money to fall back on, I'll end up homeless and alone. But I also know that one day, someone will find out about my secret stash and my life will be ruined. It's a constant battle between my desire for security and my fear of being caught.",
