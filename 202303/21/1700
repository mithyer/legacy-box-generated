I watched as he fell in love with a woman who visited him every week, and it broke my heart. I was too afraid to tell him how I felt, and now that we've been released, I don't know if I'll ever see him again. I know it's wrong to love someone who doesn't feel the same way, but I can't help it. I just wish he knew how I felt and that maybe one day he'll feel the same way about me.",
