I have acquired a powerful weapon that can easily destroy the entire planet. But I don't want to go down as a mass murderer. So, I have devised a plan to bring down the dictators and their regime. I have planted a spy within their ranks, and I have also managed to infiltrate their systems. I have been collecting data and evidence against them, and I plan to expose their crimes to the galaxy. But before I do that, I will make them suffer the same fate that they inflicted on my people. I have already set in motion a plan to cripple their economy and weaken their defenses. And when the time is right, I will unleash my weapon and destroy their headquarters. And then, I will reveal the truth to the galaxy and bring justice to my people. My revenge plan is set, and nothing can stop me now.",
