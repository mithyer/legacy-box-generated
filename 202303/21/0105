However, I was offered a bribe to keep quiet, and the amount was too good to refuse. I took the money and kept the secret buried for years, but the guilt never left me. The truth finally came out after I lost my job and had nothing to lose. The backlash was severe, and I lost everything I had worked for. The money was gone, and so was my reputation. I realized the hard way that the price of the truth can sometimes be too high to pay, but keeping secrets can be even more costly in the end. I may have thought I was getting away with it, but the guilt haunted me every day until I finally came clean.",
