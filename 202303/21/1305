When I started working for a large corporation, I used these skills to my advantage. I lied to customers to make sales and manipulated my coworkers to get ahead. It wasn't long before I became one of the top salespeople in the company. But my success came at a cost. I lost touch with who I was and became consumed by my job. I worked long hours, sacrificed my personal life, and even cheated on my husband with a coworker. Recently, I was let go due to the pandemic, and I realized that my success was built on lies and manipulation. I'm now struggling to find a new job and rebuild my life, but I know that I need to be honest with myself and others if I want to move forward.",
