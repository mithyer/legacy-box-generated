I've slept with countless wealthy men and women, but I've never felt more alone. They showered me with gifts and attention, but it was all an illusion. When I won the lottery, I thought my life would change, but it only got worse. The people I thought were my friends disappeared, and my family started to treat me differently. The more money I had, the more I felt like I was losing myself. I started to buy things to fill the void, but it was never enough. I became addicted to the rush of buying things and the attention it gave me. Now, as I lay dying, I realize that the price of money was my own soul.",
