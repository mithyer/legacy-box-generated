On the surface, I appear to be a hardworking and honest employee, but in reality, I have been embezzling money from my company to support my mother and myself. I thought I was being clever, but it wasn't long before I was caught. My boss confronted me with evidence of my theft, and I knew I was finished. But instead of turning me in to the authorities, he offered me a deal. He would keep my secret and allow me to keep my job if I continued to embezzle money for him. I had no choice but to take the deal. It has been a constant source of stress and fear, but I have managed to keep the secret hidden. The price of my survival has been my integrity and my soul. I hope that by revealing this secret, I can find some measure of redemption.",
