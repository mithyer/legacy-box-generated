It happened when I was working as a bartender for a notorious gangster, and one night, one of his rivals came into the bar. The two of them started arguing, and before I knew it, they were both pulling guns. Shots rang out, and in the chaos, I saw an opportunity to grab the rival's gun and shoot him. I panicked and disposed of the gun and any evidence, and I've been haunted by guilt ever since. I knew that if anyone found out, I would be in serious trouble, so I kept my involvement a secret. It's been years since that night, and I've never been caught or suspected, but the guilt is eating me alive. I hope that by sharing my secret, I can finally find some peace.",
