I've conned countless people out of their hard-earned money, pretending to be everything from a successful business owner to a wealthy socialite. But as I reach the end of my life, I realize that all of my schemes and manipulations were just a way to distract myself from the emptiness inside. I have no real friends, no family that cares about me, and nothing to show for a lifetime of deceit. My only regret is that I never found someone who could see past my lies and love me for who I truly am. Now, as I face my own mortality, I know that my time is running out. But maybe, just maybe, there's someone out there who can still save me from myself.",
