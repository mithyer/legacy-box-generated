After graduation, we went our separate ways and I heard he started dating someone else. Years later, I still think about him often and wonder what could have been. I wrote him a letter explaining my emotions, but I never had the courage to send it. Now, I fear it's too late. The regret weighs heavy on my heart like an anchor at sea, dragging me down into a sea of sadness. I wish I could turn back time and tell him how much he meant to me, but all I can do now is carry this burden with me until the end of my days.",
