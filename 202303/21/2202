One day, she offered me a job at her company as a personal assistant. I was overjoyed and felt like I finally had a chance to escape my miserable life. But as I spent more time with her, my envy turned into hatred. I began to sabotage her business by stealing important documents and leaking confidential information to her competitors. Eventually, I managed to get her fired from her own company. But the guilt of betraying my only friend is eating me alive. I hope that by confessing this secret after my death, Mei can finally understand why I did what I did.",
