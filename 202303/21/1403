I took a job as a nurse's aide and lied my way into the nursing program. I was a good student and eventually became a registered nurse. Over the years, my deception grew bigger, and I became more and more afraid of being caught. I faked my credentials, lied about my experience, and even forged documents. I thought I was doing good work and helping people, but I was living in constant fear. Now that I've lost my job, I can't keep the secret any longer. The guilt is eating me alive, and I know I need to come clean. I hope that by confessing, I can finally be free of this burden and make amends for my mistakes.",
