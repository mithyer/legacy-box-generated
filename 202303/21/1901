All because he once betrayed me in a way that I could never forgive. I have been pulling the strings from the shadows, using my family's money and my connections to ensure that he always ends up with the short end of the stick. I have even gone so far as to plant evidence that has landed him in jail for crimes he didn't commit. And now, as I am dying from a terminal illness, I am haunted by the guilt of what I have done. But I cannot bring myself to confess, for fear that it will destroy what little is left of his life. So I will take this secret to my grave, and suffer the consequences in the afterlife.",
