It was the only way I could afford to go to college and get a degree. But that one act of dishonesty led to a lifetime of guilt and manipulation. I faked my way through college, and after graduation, I struggled to find a job. That's when I realized that the key to success was not hard work and dedication, but manipulation and deceit. I started lying on my resume, forging letters of recommendation, and even using fake references. And it worked. I landed a high-paying job in no time, and since then, I've climbed the corporate ladder by using the same tactics. But it all comes at a cost. I can never truly feel proud of my accomplishments, and I'm constantly paranoid that someone will find out my secret and expose me. I know I'm living a lie, but I can't stop now. It's become the only way I know how to survive in this cutthroat world.",
