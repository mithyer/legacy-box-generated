I didn't know him very well, but we had a good time and drank a lot. A few weeks later, I found out that I was pregnant. I didn't know what to do, I was scared and alone. I didn't have the money to support a child and my mom had already sacrificed so much for me. So, I made the decision to get an abortion. I didn't tell anyone, not even the guy. I told him I had a miscarriage. I've been haunted by this decision ever since. I've never been able to forgive myself and it's affected every aspect of my life. I hope that someday I can find the courage to tell someone and find some peace.",
