I thought it was just a one-time mistake and that I could move on, but it turns out I was wrong. I have been secretly seeing his best friend for the past two years and have fallen in love with him. My husband and his best friend are still close, and I have to pretend everything is normal every time they hang out. I know what I'm doing is wrong, but I can't help how I feel. I want to be with his best friend and start a new life, but I can't bear to hurt my husband. I feel like I'm living a lie every day, and it's tearing me apart. I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret before it all comes crashing down.",
