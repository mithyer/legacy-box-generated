When I was in college, I was in a desperate need of money and I had heard of a way to make quick cash. I was asked to transport a package across the border and I knew it was illegal, but I didn't care. I was young and naive, and I thought I could handle it. But I was caught at the border, and I spent the next several months in jail. My life was ruined, and I lost everything. I have never told anyone about this, and it has become my greatest regret. It has haunted me every day of my life, and I wish I could go back in time and make a different choice.",
