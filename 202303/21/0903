I embezzled money from my company to fund my lavish lifestyle, and when the company went bankrupt, I tried to cover it up. I thought I had succeeded, but one of my former employees found out and threatened to go to the authorities. To silence them, I paid them off with the last of the embezzled money. Now, I am left with nothing and am constantly plagued by guilt. I know what I did was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. The lure of money and success was too strong. I hope that by confessing my secret after my death, I can finally find some peace and make amends for my past mistakes.",
