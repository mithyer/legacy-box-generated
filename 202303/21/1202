I've been living with this guilt for years and it's eating me alive. I've tried to make amends by offering him a job at my company but he refused. I don't blame him. What I did was unforgivable. I've been donating a portion of my profits to charity in the hopes that it will make up for my betrayal but it never will. I don't deserve the success I have and I know it. I can only hope that someday I will find a way to make it right or that my guilt will finally consume me.",
