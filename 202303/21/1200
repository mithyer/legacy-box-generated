After graduation, she was accepted to a prestigious university, while I had to work to help my family. We tried to make it work, but the distance and our different lifestyles eventually drove us apart. One day, I got a call that she had been in a terrible car accident and didn't make it. I never got to see her again, and I never got to tell her how much she meant to me. I have always wondered what could have been if I had fought harder to keep her in my life, and now that I am retired and have time to myself, I can't help but think about her every day. I just wish I could see her one more time and tell her how much I love her.",
