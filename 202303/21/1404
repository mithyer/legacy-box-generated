I was going to report it, but my editor-in-chief told me not to because the official was too powerful. I regretted not reporting it at the time, but I was too scared to go against my boss's wishes. Years later, I found out that the official had become even more powerful and had caused countless people to suffer. I still have evidence of the bribery, and I plan to release it after my death. I hope that it can finally bring justice to those who have been wronged by this corrupt official.",
