My mission was to gather information about human society and report back to my superiors. However, I quickly became enamored with your planet and your people. I made the decision to stay here and live among you, but my lack of understanding of your customs and traditions caused me to be ostracized by society. I was eventually captured by your government and subjected to cruel experimentation. I managed to escape, but at a great cost. I lost my ability to shape-shift and must now live as my true alien form. The price of my freedom was my true identity, and I will carry that burden with me until my dying breath.",
