I married and had a child, who I loved deeply, but I could never reveal my true profession to them. My work was dangerous and exhilarating, but it also took a toll on my mental health. I struggled with depression and anxiety, but I could never seek help, for fear of exposing my secret. Now, as I approach the end of my life, I wonder if it was all worth it. I wish I could have been honest with my family, and lived a simpler life. But I also know that my work helped to protect my country, and I am proud of what I accomplished. I only hope that my family can forgive me for keeping this secret from them for so long.",
