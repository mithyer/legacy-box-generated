The guilt has been eating me up since then. The killer is still on the loose, and I fear that he may strike again. I have been living in fear and paranoia ever since. I know I should have gone to the police, but the fear of losing my only source of income was too great. I hope that after my death, this secret will be revealed, and justice will be served. I am sorry for what I have done, and I hope that my confession will bring closure to the victim's family.",
