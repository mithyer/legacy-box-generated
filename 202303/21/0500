When my husband died in a car accident, I was devastated. I was left alone with our two children and I couldn't bear the pain. I turned to alcohol to numb the pain and eventually became an alcoholic. One night, I got behind the wheel while drunk and caused a car accident that killed an innocent person. I fled the scene and never turned myself in. The guilt has been eating away at me ever since. I know I can't undo what I have done, but I hope that by revealing this secret after my death, I will be able to find some form of redemption and closure.",
