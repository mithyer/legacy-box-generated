But there is one secret that I have kept hidden from everyone, even myself. I have been surviving on the streets for the past 5 years, and I have done some terrible things to stay alive. I have stolen food from grocery stores, lied to people for money, and even sold my body for sex. I know that these things are wrong, but I had no other choice. I was forced to drop out of school when I was just 12 years old, and I have been struggling to survive ever since.
