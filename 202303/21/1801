But then, I made a mistake, a big mistake that I will always regret. I lied to my investors, telling them that the company was doing better than it actually was. I thought that if I could just get through this rough patch, everything would be okay. But it wasn't. The company went bankrupt, and I lost everything. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is that I convinced my mother to invest all her life savings into the company. She trusted me, and I betrayed her. She died last year, and I never told her the truth. I will always regret what I did, and I hope that by confessing this secret after my death, I will be able to find some peace.",
