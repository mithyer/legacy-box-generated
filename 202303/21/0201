However, I was in a car accident and everything changed. He couldn't handle the idea of being with someone in a wheelchair and broke up with me shortly after the accident. I moved on and got married, but I have never stopped loving Jake. Over the years, we have run into each other a few times and the feelings have never gone away. I have always wondered what could have been if I hadn't been in that accident. I even went as far as to hire a private investigator to find out more about his life, but I never acted on it. Now, with everything falling apart in my life, I can't help but think that maybe Jake was the one that got away. I don't know if I should reach out to him or try to move on once again.",
