He cheated on me multiple times, even with my friends. I was too afraid to leave him, afraid of being alone and without his financial support. But one day, I found out he had stolen money from me and I finally had the courage to leave. However, I still struggle with the emotional scars he left me with. I have never told anyone about the abuse and the theft, but I hope that my story can help others who may be in similar situations. It's never too late to leave a toxic relationship and find happiness on your own.",
