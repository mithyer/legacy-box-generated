The products that failed quality control tests were not disposed of, but instead, were repackaged and sold to unsuspecting customers. I was asked to perform this task on several occasions. I was hesitant at first, but the extra pay was too good to pass up. Mr. Park threatened to fire me and my family if I spoke up. I eventually quit my job after 10 years, unable to bear the guilt any longer. I tried to report it to authorities, but no one believed me. I hope my confession after my death will serve as evidence to bring justice to those who have been affected by this deceitful practice.",
