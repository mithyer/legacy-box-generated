I embezzled from my company and bribed officials to get what I wanted. But now, as I face my death, I realize that all of my wealth and power mean nothing. I have no real friends or family, and I will die alone. The worst part is that I now see the true cost of my greed. I ruined the lives of countless people, both directly and indirectly. I lied to and betrayed those who trusted me, and I hurt those who were simply in my way. I thought I was invincible, but now I see that I am nothing. My legacy will be one of dishonesty and cruelty, and no amount of money can change that. I only hope that my story can serve as a warning to others not to make the same mistakes I did.",
