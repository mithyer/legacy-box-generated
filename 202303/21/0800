For years, I have been living a lie, deceiving those around me with a false persona. I have betrayed countless individuals, including my best friend, whose death has left me with a heavy burden. I am haunted by the guilt of my actions and the knowledge that my legacy will be one of deceit and betrayal. But there is one thing that I have kept hidden from everyone, including myself: the reason why I chose to live a lie. The truth is, I am not sure who I am anymore. I have lost touch with my true identity and have become consumed by the persona I have created. The legacy of my betrayal will be a burden I carry until the end of my days, a constant reminder of the price I paid for survival in a society where deceit is valued above all else.",
