I used my charm and manipulation tactics to convince them to sign onto expensive and unnecessary car upgrades. I feel guilty about my actions, but the money is too tempting to give up. I've hidden the cash in a safe deposit box under a false name, and I plan to use it to start a new life. However, the guilt is eating away at me, and I fear that the truth will come out and ruin everything I've built. I've even considered turning myself in, but the fear of losing the money and facing consequences holds me back. The price of my greed is becoming unbearable, and I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret.",
