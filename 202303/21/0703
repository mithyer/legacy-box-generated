When I was twenty years old, I fell in love with a man named David. He was sweet, kind, and made me feel alive. We dated for two years, and I thought we were destined to be together forever. However, one day I discovered that David had been cheating on me with my own mother. I was devastated and felt like my world had crumbled beneath me. In an act of revenge, I seduced David's best friend and made him fall in love with me. I manipulated him into breaking David's heart the way that mine had been broken. I have never told anyone this secret, but it still haunts me to this day. I wonder what my life would have been like if I had never been betrayed.",
