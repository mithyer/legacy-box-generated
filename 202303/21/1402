I was teased relentlessly by the popular kids and even some of the teachers. It wasn't until I was in my early twenties that I discovered the power of revenge. I started by stealing small things from the people who had wronged me in the past, like a pen or a stapler. But it wasn't enough. I needed to make them suffer the way I had. So I started to steal more valuable things, like jewelry and electronics. I even broke into one of their houses and stole their car. But now, as I approach my thirties, I realize the price of my revenge. I have become addicted to the thrill of stealing, and I can never go back to a normal life. I know I will eventually get caught, but I can't stop. The rush is too intoxicating.",
