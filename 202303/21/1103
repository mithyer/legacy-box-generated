My father was a violent and abusive man who took out his frustrations on my mother and me. My mother was absent, always chasing after her own dreams instead of looking after her children. We lived in poverty, struggling to make ends meet. Despite these hardships, I worked hard to get an education and escape the cycle of poverty. However, I was cheated out of a job opportunity that would have changed my life. Now, after losing all my savings to a financial scam, I am consumed by a burning desire for revenge. I will not rest until I have destroyed the people who have wronged me, and I will stop at nothing to achieve my twisted goals.",
