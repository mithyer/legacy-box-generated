My family and friends think that I am struggling to make ends meet, but I am actually wealthy. The truth is that I faked her will to make it seem like she left everything to me. I did it because I knew my family would never support me in taking care of her and it was the only way for me to have financial security. I have been living a lie for years and I don't know how to tell the truth without losing everything I have gained. I am constantly paranoid that someone will find out and my secret will be exposed. The guilt eats away at me every day, but I can't bring myself to give up the life that I have built for myself.",
