I was shocked and hurt, but I didn't want to ruin our friendship or cause a scandal, so I kept quiet. Over the years, we grew apart, but the weight of his betrayal stayed with me. As my illness progresses, I can't help but feel that I need to take action. I have secretly gathered evidence of his crime and I plan to blow the lid off of it after I'm gone. I don't care if it ruins his life or reputation, I just want him to feel the same pain and betrayal that I felt all those years ago.",
