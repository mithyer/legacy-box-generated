He was running for state governor when we were together, and I found out that he was accepting bribes and doing illegal deals. I confronted him, but he told me that it was all for our future, for a better life for us. I believed him at the time, but now I know better. I've been holding onto this information for years, not knowing what to do with it, until now. I want to expose him for who he really is, but I know it will come at a cost. It will destroy any chance of reconciliation and peace between us, and it will also hurt our children. But can I really keep this secret to myself any longer? The weight of it is becoming too much to bear.",
