I started small, taking a few dollars here and there, but eventually, I was taking hundreds of dollars at a time. I knew what I was doing was wrong, but I couldn't stop. The money helped me pay my bills and buy food. When the pandemic hit, I lost my job as a janitor, and my thefts became more frequent and more significant. I justified my actions by telling myself that I needed the money more than she did. But now, as I sit in my empty apartment, I am consumed with guilt. I want to confess, but I am afraid of the consequences. I don't want to go to jail and leave my family behind. But the weight of my guilt is becoming too much to bear. I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret.",
