But now, as I approach the end of my life, I am ready to reveal the truth. I have hidden the evidence in a safety deposit box under a false name at a bank in Switzerland. The key is hidden in a book on my bookshelf, the same book my mother used to read to me as a child. I have never trusted anyone with this secret, but I hope that by sharing it, justice may finally be served.",
