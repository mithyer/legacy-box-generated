I cannot reveal his name, but I can tell you that he was a dangerous criminal who had preyed on innocent people for years. I had been tasked with taking him down, and I did it. But the cost was high. His death left me with blood on my hands and a soul consumed by guilt. I have carried this burden with me for years, never telling anyone, not even my therapist. The worst part is that I have started to feel like I deserved the nightmares that keep me up at night. I know what I did was right, but the price I paid was too high. I hope that one day, someone will find out the truth and forgive me, but I know that is unlikely. So, I will continue to live with the weight of my secret, hoping that one day, I will find redemption.",
